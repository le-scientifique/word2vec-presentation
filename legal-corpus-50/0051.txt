(3)  work required of the supervisors by emergency conditions 
which if not performed might result in interference with operations, 
bodily injury, or loss or damage to material or equipment; and 
  
 
(4)  work which, under the circumstances then existing, it would 
be unreasonable to assign to a bargaining unit Employee and which 
is negligible in amount. 
  

  Work which is incidental to supervisory duties on a job normally 
performed by a supervisor, even though similar to duties found in jobs 
in the bargaining unit, shall not be affected by this provision. 
  
  A grievance alleging a violation of Article II, Section 2(d), shall be initiated 
at  Step  No.  2  by  the  Grievance  Committeeman  or  the  Assistant  Grievance 
Committeeman in conformity with the provisions of Article XI. If a supervisor 
performs  work  in  violation  of  this  Section  and  the  Employee  who  otherwise 
would  have  performed  the  work  can  be  reasonably  identified,  the  Company 
shall pay such Employee the applicable standard hourly wage rate for the time 
which he would have worked on the job or a four-hour minimum at standard 
hourly wage rate, whichever is greater. 
  
 
(e)  Temporary  Foremen:    (1)  An  Employee  assigned  as  a  temporary 
foreman  will  not  issue  discipline  to  Employees,  provided  that  this  provision 
will not prevent a temporary foreman from relieving an Employee from work 
for the balance of the turn for alleged misconduct.  An Employee will not be

witness  regarding  any  events  involving  discipline  which  occurred  while  the 
Employee was assigned as a temporary foreman. 
  
 
basis will not work in the bargaining unit during the week in which he is 
assigned as a temporary foreman.  An employee will not be retained in 
employment or recalled from layoff as a temporary foreman at a time 
when the application of his bargaining unit seniority would not 
otherwise result in his retention in employment or recall from layoff.

  Section 3.    Local Working Conditions 
  The term "local working conditions" as used in this Section means 
specific practices or customs which reflect detailed application of the 
subject matter within the scope of wages, hours of work, or other 
conditions of employment and includes local agreements, written or 
oral, on such matters. It is recognized that it is impracticable to set 
forth in this Agreement all of these working conditions, which are of a 
local nature only, or to state specifically in this Agreement which of 
these matters should be changed or eliminated. The provisions set forth 
below provide general principles and procedures which explain the 
status of these matters and furnish necessary guideposts for the parties 
hereto and the impartial umpire. The provisions of this Section are not 
intended to prevent the Management from continuing to make 
progress. Any arbitrations arising hereunder shall be handled on a case-
by-case basis on principles of reasonableness and equity. 
  

 
(a)  Right  to  Establish:  It is recognized that an Employee does not 
have the right to have a local working condition established, in any given 
situation or Plant where such condition has not existed, during the term of 
this Agreement or to have an existing local working condition changed or 
eliminated,  except  to  the  extent  necessary  to  require  the  application  of  a 
specific provision of this Agreement. 
  
 
(b)  Deprivation of Benefits:  In no case shall local working conditions 
be  effective  to  deprive  any  Employee  of  rights  under  this  Agreement. 
Should  any  Employee  believe  that  a  local  working  condition  is  depriving 
him  of  the  benefits  of  this  Agreement,  he  shall  have  recourse  to  the 
complaint and grievance procedure and arbitration, if necessary, to require 
that  the  local  working  condition  be  changed  or  eliminated  to  provide  the 
benefits established by this Agreement. 
  
 
(c)  Benefits in Excess:  Should there be any local working conditions 
in effect which provide benefits that are in excess of  or in addition to the 
benefits established by this Agreement, they shall remain in effect for the

02.03.01  

02.03.02

02.03.04  

benefits established by this Agreement, they shall remain in effect for the 
term of this Agreement, except as they are changed or eliminated by mutual 
agreement or in accordance with paragraph (d) below. 
  
 
(d)  Right to Change or Eliminate:  The Management shall have the 
right to change or eliminate any local working condition if, as the result of 
action  taken  by  Management  under  Article  XIII  hereof,  the  basis  for  the 
existence of the local working condition is changed or eliminated, thereby 
making it unnecessary to continue such local working condition; provided, 
however,  that  when  such  a  change  or  elimination  is  made  by  the 
Management any affected Employee shall have recourse to the complaint 
and  grievance  procedure  and  arbitration,  if  necessary,  to  have  the 
Management justify its action. 
  
(e)  Modification  of  main  Agreement:  No  local  working  condition 
 
shall hereafter be established or agreed to which changes or modifies any of 
the provisions of this Agreement, except as it is approved in writing by an 
International Officer of the Union and the Manager of Union Relations of 
the Company. 
  
 
(f)  Complaint  or  Grievance  Settlements:  The  settlement  of  a 
complaint  or  grievance  prior  to  arbitration  under  the  provisions  of  this 
Section shall not constitute a precedent in the settlement of complaints or 
grievances in other situations in this area. 
  
(g)  Settlements via Agreements: Each party shall as a matter of policy 
 
encourage  the  prompt  settlement  of  problems  in  this  area  by  mutual 
agreement at the local level.  
  

Section 4.  Contracting Out  

 
  The parties recognize the seriousness of the problems associated 
with contracting out of work both inside and outside the Plant and have 
accordingly agreed as follows: 
  
  The parties have existing rights and contractual understandings with 
respect to contracting out. In addition, the following provisions shall be 
applicable to all contracting out issues subject to, and arising on or 
after the effective date of this Agreement. 
  
 
  

(a)  Basic Prohibition 

In determining whether work should be contracted out or accomplished by 
the  bargaining  unit,  the  guiding  principle  is  that  work  capable  of  being 
performed  by  bargaining  unit  Employees  shall  be  performed  by  such 
Employees. Accordingly, the Company will not contract out any work for 
performance  inside  or  outside  the  Plant  unless  it  demonstrates  that  such 
work meets one of the following exceptions.

02.04.04  

  
 

  

  

work meets one of the following exceptions. 

(b)  Exceptions 
  
 

(1)  Work in the Plant 

a.  Production, service, all maintenance and repair work, all 

 
installation, replacement and reconstruction of equipment and 
productive facilities, other than that listed in subparagraph (b)(l)b. 
below, all within a Plant, may be contracted out if (i) the consistent 
practice has been to have such work performed by employees of 
contractors and (ii) it is more reasonable (within the meaning of 
paragraph (c) below) for the Company to contract out such work 
than to use its own Employees. 

 
b.  Major  new  construction  including  major  installation,  major 
replacement  and  major  reconstruction  of  equipment  and  productive 
facilities,  at  any  Plant  may  be  contracted  out  subject  to  any  rights  and 
obligations  of  the  parties  which  as  of  the  beginning  of  the  period 
commencing August 1, 1963, are applicable at that Plant in the case of any 
Plant which was in operation on or before August 1, 1958. With respect to 
any  other  Plant,  the  period  commencing  date shall be the date five years 
after the date on which the Plant started operations. 
  
 
A project shall be deemed major so as to fall within. the scope of this 
exception if it is shown by the Company that the project is of a grander or 
larger scale when compared to other projects bargaining unit forces at the 
Plant are  normally  expected  to  do.  Such  comparison  should  be  made  in 
light of all relevant factors. 
  
 
As regards the term "new construction" above, except for work done 
on equipment or systems pursuant to a manufacturer's warranty, work that 
is  of  a  peripheral  nature  to  major  new  construction,  including  major 
installation, major replacement and major reconstruction of equipment and 
production  facilities  and  which  does  not  concern the main body of work 
shall be assigned to Employees within the bargaining unit unless it is more 
reasonable to contract out such work taking into consideration the factors 
set forth in paragraph (c) or it is otherwise mutually agreed. For purposes of 
this  provision,  the  term  "work  of  a  peripheral  nature"  may  in  certain 
instances  include,  but  not  be  limited  to  demolition,  site  preparation,  road 
building, utility hookups, pipe lines and any work which is not integral to 
the main body. 
  
 
  
 
Should the Company contend that maintenance or repair work to 
be performed outside the Plant or work associated with the fabricating of

goods,  materials  or  equipment  purchased  or  leased  from  a  vendor  or 
supplier  should  be  excepted  from  the  prohibitions  of  this  Section,  the 
Company must demonstrate that it is more reasonable (within the meaning 
of  paragraph  (c)  below)  for  the  Company  to  contract  for  such  work 
(including the purchase or lease of the item) than to use its own Employees 
to perform the work or to fabricate the item. 

 
Notwithstanding  the  above,  the  Company  may  purchase  standard 
components  or  parts  or  supply  items  mass  produced  for  sale  generally 
("shelf items"). No item shall be deemed a standard component or part or 
supply item if:  

  

  

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

it involves a unit exchange; or 

 
its  fabrication  requires  the  use  of  prints,  sketches  or 
detailed manufacturing instructions supplied by the Company or 
at  the  Company's  behest  or  by  another  company  engaged  in 
producing or finishing steel or it is otherwise made according to 
detailed Company specifications or those of such other company; 
or 
  
 
  
 
it  involves  the  purchase  of  electric  motors,  engines, 
transmissions,  or  converters  under  a  core  exchange  program 
(whether or not title to the unit passes to the vendor/purchaser as 
part  of  the  transaction),  unless  such  transaction  is  undertaken 
with  an  original  equipment  manufacturer,  or  with  one  of  its 
authorized dealers, provided that the items in the core exchange 
program  that  are  sold  to  the  Company  are  rebuilt  using 
instructions  and  parts  supplied  by  the  original  equipment 
manufacturer  (or,  if  the  part  or  parts  are  not  stocked  by  the 
original 
such 
manufacturer). 
  
  It  is  further  provided  that  adjustments  in  the  length,  size,  or 
shape of a shelf item, so that it can be used for a Company specific 
application,  shall  be  deemed  for  the  purposes  of  this  Section 
4(b)(2)(a), to be fabrication work performed outside the Plant.

Production work may be performed outside the Plant only where 
the  Company  demonstrates  that  it  is  unable  because  of  lack  of  capital  to 
invest  in  necessary  equipment  or  facilities,  and  that  it  has  a  continuing 
commitment to the steelmaking business. In determining whether there is 
capital  to  invest  in  particular  equipment  or  facilities,  the  Company  is 
entitled to make-reasonable judgments about the allocation of scarce capital 
resources among its Plants represented by the Union and their supporting 
facilities.

(3)  Mutual Agreement 

 
  Work  contracted  out  by  mutual  agreement  of  the  parties  pursuant  to 
paragraph (g) below. 

  

(c)  Reasonableness 
  

  

  

 In determining whether it is more reasonable for the Company to 
contract out work than use its own Employees, the following factors 
shall be considered: 

(1)  Whether the bargaining unit will be adversely impacted. 

 
  
 
negative factor except for work of a temporary nature. 

(2)  The  necessity  for  hiring  new  Employees  shall  not  be  deemed  a 

  
(3)  Desirability of recalling Employees on layoff. 

(5)  Availability of adequate qualified supervision. 

(4)  Availability of qualified Employees (whether active or on layoff) 

 
  
 
for a duration long enough to complete the work. 
  
 
  
 
(6)  Availability of required equipment either on hand or by lease or 
purchase,  provided  that  either  the  capital  outlay  for  the  purchase  of  such 
equipment,  or  the  expense  of  leasing  such  equipment,  is  not  an 
unreasonable expenditure in all the circumstances at the time the proposed 
decision is made. 
  
 
associated with the work. 
  
 
(8)  Whether  the  decision  to  contract  out  the  work  is  made  to  avoid 
any  obligation  under  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  or  benefits 
agreements associated therewith. 
  
 
(9)  Whether the work is covered by a warranty necessary to protect 
the Company's investment. For purposes of this subparagraph, warranties 
are intended to include work performed for the limited time necessary to 
make effective the following seller guarantees: 
  

(7)  The  expected  duration  of  the  work  and  the  time  constraints 

a.  Manufacturer  guarantees  that  new  or  rehabilitated equipment 

 
or systems are free of errors in quality, workmanship or design. 
  
 
b.  Manufacturer guarantees that new or rehabilitated equipment 
or  systems  will  perform  at  stated  levels  of  performance  and/or

or  systems  will  perform  at  stated  levels  of  performance  and/or 
efficiency subsequent to installation. 

 
For equipment or systems ordered after August 1, 1999, and for 
the purposes of this factor only, the warranties referenced in a. and 
b. above may not be relied upon by the Company for more than 18 
months  following  acceptance;  provided,  however,  warranties  of  a 
longer  duration  may  be  relied  upon 
if  the  Company  (i) 
demonstrates that at the time of the sale such longer warranties are 
the manufacturer's published standard warranties actually offered 
to customers in the normal course of business; and (ii) reviews the 
documents  relating  to  the  warranty  and  the  sales  price  with  the 
union members of the contracting out committee at or near the time 
of the purchase. 
  
  Warranties are commitments associated with a particular product or 
service in order to assure that seller representations will be honored at 
no additional cost to the Company. Long-term service contracts are not 
warranties for the purposes of this subparagraph. 

  

  

(d)  Contracting Out Committee 

 
  

(10) 

 
In  the  case  of  work  associated  with  leased  equipment, 
whether such equipment is available without a commitment to use the 
employees  of  outside  contractors  or  lessors  for  its  operation  and 
maintenance. 
  
(11)  Whether, in connection with the subject work or generally, 
 
the  Local  Union  is  willing  to  waive  or  has  waived  restrictive  working 
conditions,  practices  or  jurisdictional  rules  (all  within  the  meaning  of 
"local  working  conditions"  and  the  authority  provided  by  this 
Agreement). 
  

 
(1)  At each Plant a regularly constituted committee consisting of 
not more than four persons (except that the committee may be enlarged 
to six persons by local agreement), half of whom shall be members of 
the  bargaining  unit  and  designated  by  the  Union  in  writing  to  the 
Management and the other half designated in writing to the Union by 
the Management, shall attempt to resolve problems in connection with 
the  operation,  application  and  administration  of 
the  foregoing 
provisions. 
  
 
In  addition to the requirements of paragraph (e) below, such 
committee  may  discuss  any  other  current  problems  with  respect  to 
contracting out brought to the attention of the committee.

(e)  Notice and Information 
  

 

Before the Company finally decides to contract out an item of 
work as to which it claims the right to contract out, the Union committee 
members will be notified. Except as provided in paragraph (i) below (Shelf 
Item Procedure), such notice will be given in sufficient time to permit the 
Union to invoke the Expedited Procedure described in paragraph (h) below, 
unless emergency situations prevent it. Such notice shall be in writing and 
shall be sufficient to  advise  the  Union  members  of  the  committee  of  the 
location, type, scope, duration and timetable of the work to be performed so 
that the Union members of the committee can adequately form an opinion 
as  to  the  reasons  for  such  contracting  out.    Such  notice  shall generally 
contain the information set forth below:

Effect on operations if work not completed in timely 

Within ninety (90) days following the effective date of this 
agreement, Headquarters representatives of the parties shall 
develop a form notice for the submission of the information 
described above. Either the Union members of the committee or the 
Company members of the committee may convene a prompt 
meeting of the committee. Should the Union committee members 
believe a meeting to be necessary, they shall so request the 
Company members in writing within five (5) days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after receipt of such notice and 
such a meeting shall be held within three (3) days (excluding 

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) thereafter. The Union members of 
the committee may include in the meeting the Union representative 
from the area in which the problem arises. At such meeting, the 
parties should review in detail the plans for the work to be 
performed and the reasons for contracting out such work. Upon 
their request, the Union members of the committee will be provided 
any and all relevant information in the Company's possession 
relating to the reasonableness factors set forth in paragraph (c) 
above. Included among the information to be made available to the 
committee shall be the opportunity to review copies of any relevant 
proposed contracts with the outside contractor. This information will 
be kept confidential. The Company members of the committee shall 
give full consideration to any comments or suggestions by the Union 
members of the committee and to any alternate plans proposed by 
Union members for the performance of the work by bargaining unit 
personnel. Except in emergency situations, such discussions, if 
requested shall take place before any final decision is made as to 
whether or not such work will be contracted out. 

Should  the  Company  committee  members  fail  to  give  notice  as 
provided  above,  then  not  later  than  thirty  (30)  days  from  the  date  of  the 
commencement  of  the  work  a  grievance  relating  to  such  matter  may  be 
filed under the complaint and grievance procedure.  Should it be found in 
the arbitration of a grievance alleging a failure of the Company to provide 
the notice or information required under this paragraph (e) that such notice 
or  information  was  not  provided,  that  the  failure  was  not  due  to  an 
emergency  requirement,  and  that  such  failure  deprived  the  Union  of  a 
reasonable  opportunity  to  suggest  and  discuss  practicable  alternatives  to 
contracting out, the Impartial Umpire shall have the authority to fashion a 
remedy, at his discretion, that he deems appropriate to the circumstances of 
the  particular  case.    Such  remedy,  if  afforded,  may  include  earnings  and 
benefits to grievants who would have performed the work, if they can be 
reasonably identified. 

(f)  Remedy for Repeated Notice Violations 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, where, at a 
particular Plant, it is found that the Company (i) committed violations of 
paragraph (e) that demonstrate willful conduct in violation of the notice 
provision or constitutes a pattern of conduct of repeated violations or (ii) 
violated a cease and desist order previously issued by the Impartial Umpire 
may, as circumstances warrant, fashion a suitable remedy or penalty. 

(g)  Mutual Agreement and Disputes 
  

The  committee  may  resolve  the  matter  by  mutually  agreeing  that  the 
work  in  question  either  shall  or  shall  not  be  contracted  out.  Any  such

work  in  question  either  shall  or  shall  not  be  contracted  out.  Any  such 
resolution  shall  be  final  and  binding  but  only  as  to  the  matter  under 
consideration and shall not affect future determinations under this Section. 

  
If the matter is not resolved, or if no discussion is held, the dispute may 
be processed further (i) by filing a grievance relating to such matter under 
the  complaint  and  grievance  procedure  described  in  Article  XI;  or  (ii)  by 
submitting the matter to the Expedited Procedure set out in paragraph (h) 
below. 

  
No  agreement  entered  into  after  August  1,  1999,  whether  or  not 
reached pursuant to this Section, which directly or indirectly permits the 
contracting  out  of  work  on  an  ongoing  basis,  shall  be  valid  or 
enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by both the President and 
the Chairman of the Grievance Committee of the affected local Union. 

(h)  Expedited Procedure  

In the event that either the Union or Company members of the 
committee request an expedited resolution of any dispute arising 
under this Section, except paragraph (i) (Shelf Item Procedure), it 
shall be submitted to the Expedited Procedure in accordance with 
the following: 

(1) 

 
In  all  cases  except  those  involving  day-to-day  maintenance and 
repair  work  and  service,  the  Expedited  Procedure  shall  be  implemented 
prior to letting a binding contract. 

  
 
(2)  Within  three  (3)  days  (excluding  Saturdays,  Sundays  and 
holidays)  after  either  the  Union  or  Company  members  of  the  committee 
determine  that  the  committee  cannot  resolve  the  dispute,  either  party 
(chairman of the grievance committee in the case of the Local Union and 
the  Superintendent  of  Labor  Relations  in  the  case  of  the  Company)  may 
advise the other in writing that it is invoking this Expedited Procedure. 
  
 
(3)  An expedited arbitration must be scheduled within three (3) days 
(excluding Saturdays, Sunday; and holidays) of such notice and heard at a 
hearing  commencing  within  five  (5)  days  (excluding  Saturdays,  Sundays 
and holidays) thereafter. The Impartial Umpire, or his appointee, shall hear 
the dispute and, if no Umpire is available to hear the dispute within five (5) 
days, another arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the Step 
No. 4 Representative of the Union and the Step No. 4 Representative of the 
Company. 
  
 
The  arbitrator  must  render  a  decision  within  forty-eight  (48) 
hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the conclusion of the 
hearing. Such decision shall not be  cited as a precedent by either party in 
any future contracting out disputes.

(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any case 
heard in the Expedited Procedure before the work in dispute was performed 
may be reopened by the Union in accordance with this paragraph if such 
work,  as  actually  performed,  varied  in  any  substantial  respect  from  the 
description presented in arbitration, except where the difference involved a 
good  faith  variance  as  to  the  magnitude  of  the  project.  The  request  to 
reopen  the  case  must  be  submitted  within  seven  (7)  days  of  the  date  on 
which  the  Union  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  variance  and  shall 
contain a summary of the ways in which the work as actually performed 
differed  from  the  description  presented  in  arbitration.  As  soon  as 
practicable after receipt of a request to reopen, an arbitration hearing date 
shall  be  scheduled.  In  a  case  reopened  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  the 
Impartial Umpire shall determine whether the work in dispute, as it actually 
was performed, violated the provisions of Section 4 and, if so, the remedy. 
The  prior  decision  regarding  the  subject  work  shall  be  considered  in  the 
determination  and  given  weight  in  the  subsequent  dispute,  except  to  the 
extent that it relied on an erroneous description. 
  
(i)  Contractors Testifying In Arbitration  

No testimony offered by an outside contractor may be considered in any 
proceeding  alleging  a  violation  Of  Section  4  unless  the  party  calling  the 
contractor provides the other party with a copy of each contractor document 
to be offered at least forty-eight (48)-hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays 
and holidays) before commencement of that hearing. 

Shelf Item Procedure 

(j) 
 
(1)  No  later  than  June  1,  1994,  and,  except  as  provided  herein, 
annually thereafter, the Company shall provide the Union members of the 
committee with a list and description of anticipated ongoing purchases of 
each item which the Company claims to be a shelf item within the meaning 
of  paragraph  (b)(2)a.  above.  If  the  Union  members  of  the  committee  so 
request, the list shall not include any item included on a previous list where 
the status of the item, as a shelf item, has been expressly resolved. Within 
sixty (60) days of the submission of the list, either the Union members of 
the committee or the Company members may convene a prompt meeting of 
the committee to discuss and review the list of items and, if requested, the 
facts underlying the Company's claim that such items are shelf items. 
  
 
(2)  The committee may resolve the matter by mutually agreeing that 
the item in question either is or is not a shelf item. With respect to any item 
as to which the Union members of the committee agree with the Company's 
claim that it is a shelf item, the Company shall be relieved of any obligation 
to  furnish  a  contracting  out  notice  until  the  June  1  next  following  such 
agreement and thereafter, if the Union has requested that a resolved item be

agreement and thereafter, if the Union has requested that a resolved item be 
deleted from the shelf item list in accordance with paragraph (j)(1). 
  
 
If the matter is not resolved, any dispute may be processed further 
by  filing,  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  date  of  the  last  discussion,  a 
grievance in Step 3 of the complaint and grievance procedure described in 
Article  XI.  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (j)(5),  such  a  grievance  shall 
include all items in dispute. However, where a number of items raise the 
same  or  similar  issues,  those  items  may  be  grouped  in  a  single  class  or 
category. 
  
 
(4)  An item which the Company claims to be a shelf item, but which 
was  not  included  on  the  list  referred  to  above  because  no  purchase  was 
anticipated,  shall  be  listed  and  described  on  a  contracting  out  notice 
provided to the Union not later than the regularly scheduled meeting of the 
contracting out committee next following purchase of the item. Thereafter, 
the parties shall follow the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) 
above. 
  
 
(5)  The Union may file a grievance in accordance it paragraph (g)  or 
(h) of this Section 4 with respect to any unresolved item of maintenance, 
repair  work  or  work  associated  with  the  fabrication  of goods, material or 
equipment  performed  outside  the  Plant  notwithstanding  the  inclusion  of 
such  item  on  the  shelf  item  list  previously furnished to the Union by the 
Company,  provided  such  grievance  is  filed  within thirty (30) days of the 
date on which the Union knew or should have known of the performance of 
the work. 

  

 

(k)  Annual Review 

  
Commencing  on  or  before  January  2  of  each  year  the  Company 
committee members shall meet with the Union committee members for the 
purpose of (i) reviewing all work whether inside or outside the Plant which 
the  Company  anticipates  may  be  performed  by  outside  contractors  or 
vendors  at  some  time  during  the  following  twelve  (12)  months,  (ii) 
determining  such  work  which  should  be  performed  by  bargaining  unit 
Employees  and  (iii)  identifying  situations  where  the  elimination  of 
restrictive practices would promote the performance  of any such work by 
bargaining  unit  Employees.  The  Union  committee  members  shall  be 
entitled in conducting this study to review any current or proposed contracts 
concerning  items  of  work  performed  by  the  Company  by  outside 
contractors and vendors and shall keep such information confidential. 

  
By no later than February 1 of each year the Local Union and Company 
committee members shall jointly submit a written report to the International 
President  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Company  or  their 
designees  describing  the  results  of  this  review.  Specifically,  the  report

designees  describing  the  results  of  this  review.  Specifically,  the  report 
should list (a) all items of work which the parties agree will be performed 
by  bargaining  unit  Employees  during  the  following  twelve  (12)  calendar 
months, (b) all items of work  which the parties agree should be performed 
by outside contractors and vendors, and (c) those items on which the parties 
disagree.  If  the  parties  disagree,  the  report  will  state  the  reason  for  such 
disagreements. 

the  Company  may 

As to individual items of work, the International President and the Chief 
Executive  Officer  of

recommendation, (b) disagree with respect to the Plant recommendation as 
to  specific  items  and  either  (i)  refer  their  dispute  to  arbitration  under  a 
procedure to be established by the parties and the Impartial Umpire or (ii) 
refer  the  matters  back  to  the  Plant  without  resolution  in  which  event  the 
specific disputes will be handled under the provisions of this section at the 
time they may arise. 

(a)  affirm 

(l)  District Director/Company Union Relations Representative 

  
It  is  the  intent  of  the  parties  that  the  members  of  the  joint  Plant 
contracting  out  committee  shall  engage  in  discussions  of  the  problem 
involved in this field in a good-faith effort to arrive at mutual understanding 
so that disputes and grievances can be avoided. If either the Company or 
the Union members of the committee feel that this is not being done, they 
may appeal to the District Director of the Union who has jurisdiction of the 
Plant  in  question  and  the  appropriate  representative  of  the  Company 
Headquarters for review of the complaint about the failure of the committee 
to properly function. Such appeal shall result in a prompt investigation by 
the  District  Director  or  his  designated  representative  and  the  Company's 
Union Relations Representative for such review. This provision should in 
no way affect the rights of the parties in connection with the processing of 
any grievance relating to the subject of contracting out.

enforced, and who fails voluntarily to acquire or maintain membership 
in the Union, shall be required as a condition of employment, beginning 
on the 30th day following the beginning of such employment or the 
date of this Agreement, whichever is later, to pay to the Union each

(e)  Agreement  to  Check  Off:    Upon  receipt  by  the  Superintendent  of 
Labor  Relations  at  any  Plant  of  a  voluntary  written  assignment  (in  a  form 
agreed to in writing by the Company and the Union) by an Employee at such 
Plant, the Company will deduct from each pay of such Employee each month 
thereafter during the existence of such assignment his periodic Union dues or 
service charges as designated by the International Treasurer of the Union. The 
Company shall also deduct any assessments against him which shall be general 
and uniform among Employees who shall at the time be members of the Union,

increments  between  job  classes  shall  be  applied  to  reduce  or  eliminate  any 
personal out-of-line differential of any Employee who has a "red circle" hourly 
wage rate or a "red circle" guaranteed occupational hourly rate. Except as so 
reduced  or  eliminated,  such  "red  circle"  rate  shall  remain  in  effect  for  such

(b)  Plant Union job Evaluation Committee: The Union at each Plant shall 
designate a Plant Union job Evaluation Committee. Such Committee shall have 
the  exclusive  right  to  certify  the  existence  of  disputes  with  respect  to  job 
classifications. 
  
(c)  Classification Procedures: Whenever a new job shall be established 
 
or,  after  the  effective  date  of  the  last  classification  or  reclassification  of  an 
existing  job,  the  requirements  of  such  job  as  to  training,  skill,  responsibility, 
effort  and  surroundings  shall  have  been  altered  to  the  extent  of  a  whole 
numerical  classification  of  1.0  or  more,  the  Management  shall  classify  or 
reclassify such job, as the case may be, and the new classification shall be put 
into effect in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Section. 
  

 
(1)  Effecting a New job: The Management shall describe and classify 
such job in accordance with the Manual for job Classification of Production 
and Maintenance jobs dated August 1, 1971, (hereinafter referred to as the 
Manual) and shall present such description and classification to the  Plant 
Union job Evaluation Committee. At the same time, copies of the proposed 
description and classification shall be sent to a designated representative of 
the  International  Union.  If  the  job  involves  a  new-type facility or a new-
type  job,  special  designation  of  this  fact  shall  be  made.  Thereafter,  the 
Management  may  put  such  new  classification  into  effect  and  it  shall 
continue  in  effect,  unless  it  shall  be  changed  in  the  manner  provided  in 
subparagraph (c)(3) of this Section. The Management and the Plant Union 
job Evaluation Committee shall meet, within 30 days after the description 
and  classification  shall  have  been  presented  as  herein  above  provided,  to 
review and attempt to agree on the proposed classification of such job. 
  
 
(2)  Plant Union job Evaluation Committee Agrees: If the Plant Union 
job Evaluation Committee shall agree to such proposed new classification, 
it shall be established for such job. 
  
 
(3)  Plant  Union  job  Evaluation  Committee  Does  Not  Agree: If the 
Plant  Union  job  Evaluation  Committee  does  not  agree  to  such  proposed 
new classification, such Committee may, at any time within 15 days after 
the  meeting,  give  written  notice  to  the  designated  representative  of  the 
Management  alleging  that  the  job  is  improperly  classified  under  the 
provisions of the Manual. Within 7 days thereafter, such Committee and the 
designated  representative  of  the  Management  shall  prepare  and  sign  a 
stipulation setting forth the factors and factor codings which are in dispute 
and shall send it to the Manager of Union Relations of the Company. The 
parties shall make a sincere effort to set forth in such stipulation the reasons 
in support of their respective positions.

The  Step  No.  4  representatives  shall  meet  within  30  days  after  the 
stipulation  has  been  sent  to  the  Manager  of  Union  Relations  of  the 
Company.  If  they  are  unable  to  agree  on  the  classification,  they  shall 
prepare and sign a stipulation (which may amend the stipulation set forth by 
the  Plant  Union  job  Evaluation  Committee and the Management) setting 
forth the factors and factor codings which are in dispute, a copy of which 
shall  be  sent  to  the  aforementioned  representative  of  the  International 
Union. The parties shall make a sincere effort to set forth in such stipulation 
the reasons in support of their respective positions. 
  
 
The  Union's  Step  No.  4  representative  may,  within  30  days  after  the 
Step No. 4 meeting or within 20 days after the stipulation shall have been 
first  received  by  him,  whichever  of  those periods shall last expire, appeal 
the issues in dispute to arbitration by notice in writing to the Manager of 
Union Relations of the Company. If submitted to arbitration, the issue shall 
be limited to the factors finally stipulated as being in dispute. The impartial 
umpire  shall  decide  the  factors  in  dispute  in  accordance  with  the  Manual 
and his decision with regard thereto shall be effective as of the date when 
the new job was established or the change or changes installed but in no 
event earlier than the date on which the new or changed classification was 
first submitted to the Plant Union job Evaluation Committee. 
  
 
If  the  parties  shall  fail  to  agree  as  provided  above  and  a  request  for 
review or arbitration is not made within the time provided, the classification 
as prepared by the Management shall be deemed to have been approved. 

  
 
(d)  Change  in  job:  If  the  Plant  Union  job  Evaluation  Committee  shall 
claim that after the effective date of the last classification or reclassification of 
an existing job the requirements of such job as to training, skill, responsibility, 
effort  and  surroundings  shall  have  been  altered  to  the-  extent  of  a  whole 
numerical classification of 1.0 or more or if such Committee shall believe that 
a new job has been established and that the Management has failed to present a 
description and classification of such job to the Committee, it may submit a 
written,  grievance  with  respect  to  such  job  classification  to  the  designated 
representative  of  the  Management  which  shall  be  handled  in  the  manner 
provided in subparagraph (c)(3) of this Section. If such grievance is submitted 
to arbitration, the decision of the impartial umpire shall be in accordance with 
the  Manual  and  shall  be  effective  as  of  the  date  the  change  in  job  content 
occurred  or  the  new  job  classification  was  submitted,  but  in  no  event  earlier 
than 30 days prior to the date the grievance was presented in written form to 
the Management. 
  

(e)  Extension of Time Limits: Any of the time limitations set forth in this 

 
Section may be extended by agreement between the parties. 
  
 
(f)  Change in Classification by Agreement: The classification of any job 
may  be  changed  by  agreement  in  writing  between  the  Management  and  the

may  be  changed  by  agreement  in  writing  between  the  Management  and  the 
Plant Union job Evaluation Committee. 
  
 
(g)  Recorded Changes: Whenever the Management shall record a change 
on  a  job  description  form  or  a  job  classification  form,  it  shall  give  the  Plant 
Union job Evaluation Committee written notice of such change. 
  
(h)  Apprentice Jobs: Apprentice jobs in any craft job named in Part VI A 
 
of  the  Manual  are  not  to  be  described  or  classified.  Employees  serving 
apprenticeships in any of such craft jobs shall be assigned job classes as set 
forth in Appendix 2B. 
  

 
(i)  Learner jobs: Learner jobs are not to be described or classified. Any 
learner  job  shall  be  assigned  to  job  Class  2;  provided,  however,  that  an 
Employee who shall be transferred from another job in the particular Plant to a 
learner job shall remain in the job class for his former job during the learning 
period unless the Management, a steward of the Union and the Employee shall 
agree that he shall be placed in a lower job class during his learner period. 
  
  Employees may be assigned to learner jobs for the purpose of training them 
for any regular job subject to the following limitations: 
  

  
(1)  An Employee shall be assigned to a learner job only until he can 
perform satisfactorily the job for which he is being trained, but in no event 
shall he be assigned to such job for more than 520 hours of actual work 
therein as a learner; 

  

  

  

  
(2)  The job for which the Employee is being trained is a job for which 
another  job  to  which  he  has  previously  been  assigned has not provided 
adequate training; 

 
(3)  The  job  for  which  the  Employee  is  being  trained  has  been 
classified  with  a  value  of  B  (3  to  6  months)  or  more  in  Factor  2 
(Employment Training and Experience); 

(4)  The Employee is being trained for a specific job to which he 

 
will be assigned upon successful completion of his training period, 
unless circumstances, such as a reduction in the force assigned to 
that job, make such assignment impossible; and 

(5)  The job is not a craft helper, maintenance helper, or repair 

  
 
helper job. 
  
  The limitation set forth in paragraph (4) above does not preclude 
the training of an Employee for the purpose of having a substitute for a 
regularly assigned Employee available. That limitation does not require 
the assignment of the Employee to the position for which he is in

Incentives 

  
(a)  Existing  Incentives:    Each  incentive  now  in  effect  or  hereafter 
 
established  shall  remain  in  effect,  except  as  changed  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions  of  this  Section  or  of  the  Supplemental  Agreement  dated  May  25, 
1956, between the parties hereto. The term "incentive" as used in this Section 
means any incentive plan and the incentive rates under such plan (including: 
tonnage  rates;  premium  rates;  piece  rates  of  continuing  application;  and 
standards and guides used in the calculation of piece rates other than those of 
continuing application). The term "standard hourly wage rate" as used in this 
Section means the applicable standard hourly wage rate shown in Appendix 2. 
  

the 

  

(1)  Union 

Incentive  Committee:  In 

  
interest  of  effective 
administration  of  the  Incentive  Programs  and  effective  processing  of 
incentive  grievances  under  this  Section,  a  Local  Union  Committee  on 
incentives  (hereinafter  called  the  Union  Incentive  Committee)  shall  be 
established  in  each  Local  Union.  The  Union  Incentive  Committee  shall 
consist of three members, two of whom shall be permanent members of the 
Committee and shall be appointed by the President of the Local Union, one 
of  whom  shall  be  designated  as  Chairman.  The  third  member  shall  be  a 
Department  Representative  from  the  zone  or  area  involved.  The  local 
parties  shall  develop  a  familiarization  program  designed  to  make  the 
permanent  members  of  the  Union  Incentive  Committee  informed  on 
matters relative to the development and administration of incentives. 

  
(2)  Complaints  and  Grievances:  The  Union  Incentive  Committee 
shall  assist  the  Grievance  Committeemen  and  participate  in  handling 
incentive  complaints  or  grievances  with  respect  to  new  or  changed 
incentives  in  Step  No.  2  and  Step  No.  3  of  the  complaint and grievance 
procedure  and  may  participate  in  Step  No.  4  of  the  grievance  procedure 
when  the  certified  Step  No.  4  representatives  deem  it  advisable.  The 
Chairman  of  the  Plant  Union  Incentive  Committee  shall  be  permitted  to 
initiate complaints into the complaint and grievance procedure on behalf of 
Employees affected by alleged violations of Article V, Sections 2 and 3. 
  

  
Incentive Checklist:  In order that the parties develop all the facts 
in Step No. 2 of the complaint and grievance procedure on matters relating 
to  incentive  complaints,  an  Incentive  Checklist  shall  be  designed  by  the 
parties to serve as a guide for development of the facts for proper review in 
the complaint and grievance procedure. All information developed from the 
Incentive Checklist should be embodied in the written record of Step No. 2.

(b)  Right  to  Establish  Incentives:  The  Management  shall  have  the 
exclusive right to establish an incentive (1) for any new job (other than a new 
job  which  replaces  a  job to which an incentive had been applicable), (2) for 
work which shall not at the time be paid on an incentive basis, or (3) where the 
Management shall eliminate an incentive in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (g) of this Section. Any such new  incentive shall be established in 
accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (d) of this Section, shall 
be  based  upon  the  applicable  standard  hourly  wage  rate  and  shall  provide 
equitable compensation.* 

in  equipment,  changes 

  
 
(c)  Recognized Change: The parties hereto recognize that it may become 
necessary  or  desirable  from  time  to  time  that  a  then  existing  incentive  be 
adjusted  or  replaced  because  of  changes 
in 
manufacturing processes or in materials processed or in methods or standards 
of  manufacture  or  production,  the  development  of  new  manufacturing 
processes or methods, or mechanical improvements made by the Company in 
the interest of improved methods or products. Whenever any of such changes 
or such other events occurs and for that reason the Management shall deem it 
necessary or desirable to adjust an existing incentive (or, if appropriate in view 
of  the  changes,  to  replace  an  existing  incentive  plan),  the  Management  shall 
establish  a  new  incentive  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  set  forth  in 
paragraph  (d)  of  this  Section.  Such  new  incentive  shall  be  based  upon  the 
applicable  standard  hourly  wage 
rate  and  shall  provide  equitable 
compensation,* provided that, giving due effect to the change or other event by 
reason  of  which  the  new  incentive  shall  have  been  established,  the  new 
incentive shall be designed to provide compensation (including all guarantees, 
allowances and payments in connection with such new incentive) at least equal 
to the compensation that would have been provided under the incentive which 
it replaced. 
  
 
in accordance with the following procedure: 
  

(d)  Procedure for New Incentives: Any new incentive shall be established 

 
(1)  Develop, Explain, Make Effective: The Management shall develop 
the incentive and present it to the Union Incentive Committee. It shall also 
furnish  to  the  Union  Incentive  Committee  and  a  reasonable  number  of 
representatives  of  the  affected  Employees  as  the  parties  deem  advisable 
information and explanation with regard to the proposed incentive as shall 
reasonably  be  required  to  enable  them  to  understand  the  new  incentive. 
After  notifying  the  Union  Incentive  Committee  of  the  date  on  which  the 
incentive shall be made effective, the Management may put the incentive 
into effect. 

  

                                                   
*The term "equitable compensation" is defined in the Memorandum of 
Understanding of January 4, 1960.

(2)  Trial  Basis:  Any  incentive  may  be  installed  on  a  trial  or 
experimental  basis,  provided  the  Management  and  the  Union  Incentive 
Committee  so  agree,  in  which  case  such  agreement  shall  include  the 
duration  of  such  trial  or  experimental  period  and  any  special  guarantees 
which may be made applicable. 

(3)  Complaint  or  Grievance  Time  Period:  The  grievance 
 
committeeman may, at any time after 30 days but not later than 180 days 
following the effective date of a new incentive, initiate a complaint in Step 
No.  2  regarding  such  incentive,  in  which  event  such  complaint  shall  be 
handled in accordance with the procedure set forth in Article XI hereof. If a 
trial or experimental period has been agreed upon, the applicable time limit 
for initiating a complaint regarding such incentive shall apply as of the end 
of  such  trial  or  experimental  period.  If  such  complaint  shall  not  be  so 
initiated before the expiration of said 180 days, the Union shall be deemed 
to  have  agreed  that  such  new  incentive shall become established. If such 
complaint  or  subsequent  grievance  shall  be  submitted  to  arbitration  as 
provided in said Article XI, the decision of the impartial umpire with regard 
thereto shall be effective as of the date when the Management shall have 
put such new incentive into effect. 

(4) 

Interim  Rates:  If  the  Management,  in  accordance  with  the 
 
provisions  of  this  Section,  shall  cancel  an  existing  incentive  applicable  to 
any work prior to the establishment of the new incentive which is to replace 
it,  or  if  an  Employee  shall  perform  work  which,  except  for  one  of  the 
changes specified in paragraph (c) of this Section, would have continued to 
be  paid  for  on  an  incentive  basis,  during  the  period  preceding  the 
establishment of the new incentive on such work each Employee who shall 
perform such work shall be paid, for all such work performed by him, at an 
interim hourly rate. Such interim hourly rate shall be equal to the average 
hourly earnings (not including overtime compensation or  shift or Sunday 
premiums)  of  all  Employees  who  were  assigned  to  the  job  on  which  the 
work  was  performed  during  the  3  months'  period  next  preceding  the 
cancellation or non-payment of such existing incentive or, in the case of a 
new job as to which there is a requirement to install an incentive, such rate 
as shall be reasonably related to the average excess above standard hourly 
wage rates paid on the related jobs being replaced, giving due regard to the 
relationship of earnings in the promotional sequence involved. In any event, 
it  may  be  such  other  interim  hourly  rate  as  shall  be  agreed  to  by  the 
Management and the Union Incentive Committee. If they fail to agree, then 
it  may  be  such  other  interim  hourly  rate  as  shall  be  agreed  to  by  the 
respective  Step  No.  4  representatives  of  the  parties.  Such  interim  hourly 
rate  shall  be  paid  to  such  Employee  only  so  long  as  he  maintains  the 
average performance on such job during such prior 3 months' period. If he 
voluntarily  maintains  a  performance  appreciably  below  such  average 
performance  of  such  prior  3  months'  period,  after  notification  to  such 
Employee  and  the  Union  Incentive  Committee,  the  Management  may 

Employee  and  the  Union  Incentive  Committee,  the  Management  may 
suspend payment of such interim hourly rate. 

  
 
(e)  Unfair  and  Unreasonable  Incentives:  Subject  to  the  provisions  of 
Section 1 of Article XI of this Agreement, if any Employee shall claim that by 
reason of any change or other event specified in paragraph (c) of this Section 
which shall occur, his incentive has become unreasonable and unfair, he may 
initiate a complaint in respect thereof and such complaint shall be handled in 
accordance  with  the  procedure  set  forth  in  Article  XI  hereof.  If  in  the 
determination of such complaint or subsequent grievance such incentive shall 
be  changed,  the  new  incentive  shall  be  established  in  accordance  with  the 
principles set forth in paragraph (c) of this Section. 
  
 
(f)  Agreement  to  Revise  or  Replace:  Any  incentive  may  be  revised  or 
replaced  by  agreement  in  writing  between  the  Management  and  the  Union 
Incentive Committee for the applicable Local Union. 
  
 
(g)  Elimination  and  Replacement:  If  the  average  straight-time  hourly 
earnings of the Employees paid under a particular incentive plan, for the pay 
periods ended during the preceding calendar quarter, are lower than or equal to 
the standard hourly wage rates of such Employees, the Company may eliminate 
such plan provided the Management replaces such plan with a new or adjusted 
plan in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section. 

  

  Section 3.  Due Effect Revisions 

  
 
If prior to the time when an existing incentive plan shall be replaced with a 
new  incentive  plan  under  the  provisions  of  Section  5  of  the  Supplemental 
Agreement  dated  May  25,  1956,  an  existing  incentive  wage  rate  shall  be 
adjusted because of the occurrence of any of the changes or events set forth in 
Section 2(c) of this Article, such adjustment shall be made in accordance with 
the procedure of Section 2 of this Article and the adjusted incentive shall be 
developed  by  the  Management  in  accordance  with  the  usual  practice  now  in 
effect  with  it  at  the  Plant  and  on  the  principle  that  the  new  incentive  shall, 
giving  due  effect  to  the  change  or  other  events  by  reason  of  which  the  new 
incentive  shall  have  been  established,  be  in  equitable  relationship  to  the 
incentive which it replaced and provide equitable compensation.

Section 1. Normal Hours of Work  

ARTICLE VII—HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME 
  
 
  
  
(a)  Scheduling the Norm:  In accordance with the practice prevailing at the 
respective Plants, the normal daily hours of work shall be 8 consecutive hours, 
excluding luncheon periods and rest periods where such periods are provided, 
and the normal weekly hours of work shall be 40 hours. The Management Will 
make a diligent effort so to schedule Employees for work that at least 85% of the 
Employees at any Plant shall be scheduled for work on a normal work pattern of 
5  consecutive  workdays  followed  by  2  consecutive  days  off  in  each  7 
consecutive days. If an Employee shall receive 4 consecutive days off in each 14 
consecutive  days  pursuant  to  an  agreement  between  the  Management  and  the 
Grievance Committee,, such Employee may be included in computing such 85%. 
Each Employee assigned to a working schedule agreed to by the Management 
and the Grievance Committee and which does not provide 2 consecutive days off 
in each 7 consecutive days or 4 consecutive days off in each 14 consecutive days 
may be included in computing such 85%. if an Employee shall be paid at the 

may be included in computing such 85%. if an Employee shall be paid at the 
overtime rate hereinafter in this Article specified for all hours worked by him on 
any day, then, for the purpose of computing such 85%, that day shall be counted 
as a day off. The Management will also endeavor to give Employees notice of 
any changes in their weekly working schedules in time to enable them to make 
changes in their plans in order to meet such schedules.  
  
(b)  Posing  of  Schedules:    Schedules  of  the  Employees  regular  workdays 
  
shall  be  posted  or  otherwise  made  known  to  Employees  in  accordance  with 
prevailing practices at  the respective Plants, when practicable on Thursday but 
not later than Friday of the week preceding the calendar week in which they shall 
be  effective;  provided,  however,  that  in  the  case  of  breakdowns  or  other 
conditions beyond the control of the Management or because of the requirements 
of the business the Management may change such schedules after Friday of the 
week  preceding  the  calendar  week  in  which  they  shall  be  effective.    Should 
changes be made in schedules contrary to this Section 1(b) so that an Employee 
is laid off and does not work on a day that he was scheduled to work, he shall be 
deemed to have reported for work on such day and shall be eligible for reporting 
allowance in accordance with provisions of Section 7 of this Article VII. 
  
 
(c)  Guarantee of Hours: The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not 
be construed as guaranteeing to any Employee any number of hours of work per 
day  or  per  week.  The  Management  will  from  time  to  time  furnish  to  the 
Grievance  Committee  such  information  as  such  Committee  shall  reasonably 
request with regard to the compliance by the Management with the provisions of 
this Section. 

  

 

Section 2. Starting Times 

  

  

  The starting times of regular turns at the respective Plants shall be determined 
from time to time by the Management, and, in so far as practicable, notice of any 
change  in  any  such  starting  time  shall  be  posted  on  the  bulletin  boards  in  the 
departments affected thereby at least 48 hours before such change shall become 
effective. 

Section 3. Conditions Under Which Overtime Rates 

 
Shall Apply  
  
(a)  Overtime  compensation  at  the  rate  of  one  and  one-half  times  the 
 
Employee's  regular  rate  of  pay  (as  hereinafter  in  Section  5  of  this  Article 
defined) shall be paid for all time worked by such Employee,  
  

(1) 

in excess of 8 hours within a workday; provided, however, that the 

 
same hours shall not be included in more than one workday, or

(2) 

in excess of 40 hours within a payroll week, or  

 
  
(3)  on any workday within a payroll week after he shall have worked on 
 
5 previous days in that week; provided, however, that for the purpose of this 
clause (3) an Employee shall be deemed to have worked on any of such 5 
previous workdays on which he shall have been scheduled to work and on 
which he did not work because his schedule was changed after Friday of the 
preceding  week,  but  this  proviso  shall  not  be  applicable  to  changes  in 
schedules in the case of breakdowns or other conditions beyond the control 
of the Management, or  
  
 
(4)  on  any  sixth  or  seventh  workday  of  a  7-consecutive-day  period 
during which the first 5 days were worked by the Employee whether or not 
all of such days fall within the same payroll week as defined in Section 5(b) 
of  this  Article,  except  when  that  day  is  worked  pursuant  to  a  schedule 
approved by the Grievance Committee; provided, however, that no overtime 
compensation  under  this  provision  will  be  due  unless  the  Employee  shall 
notify his foreman of a claim for overtime within a period of one week after 
such  sixth  or  seventh  day  is  worked  or,  if  he  fails  to  do  so,  initiates  a 
complaint claiming such overtime within 30 days after such day is worked; 
and  provided  further  that  on  shift  changes the 7-consecutive-day period of 
168 hours may become 152 consecutive hours depending upon the change in 
the  shift.  For  the  purposes  of  this  clause  (4)  all  working  schedules  now 
normally used (where approval has not been withdrawn) in any department of 
any  Plant  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  approved  by  the  Grievance 
Committee. Such approval may be withdrawn by the Grievance Committee 
by giving 60 days' prior written notice thereof to the Management, or  

  

(5)  on a second reporting in the same workday where the Employee has 
 
been recalled or required to report to the Plant after working less than 8 hours 
on  his  first  shift,  provided  that  his  failure  to  work  8  hours  on  his  first 
reporting was not caused by any of the factors mentioned in Section 7 of this 
Article for purposes of disqualifying an Employee for reporting allowance.  

  
 
(b)  Overtime  compensation  shall  be  paid  for  all  time  worked  by  an 
Employee on a holiday as defined in Article VIII of this Agreement at the rate of 
two and one-half times the Employee's regular rate of pay.  
  
 
(c)  Where local practices or agreements with respect to the distribution of 
overtime  currently  allow  overtime  work  opportunities  to  be  distributed 
unequally, the Management and the Local Union shall conclude by July 1, 1990, 
an  agreement  providing  for  equitable  overtime  distribution  consistent  with  the 
efficiency  of  the  operation.  If  agreement  is  not  reached  by  July  1,  1990,  the 
Management  may 
implement  necessary  equitable  overtime  distribution 
procedures, changed to the extent necessary to provide equitable distribution of 
overtime work opportunities.

Section 4. Overtime Computation Non-

  
 
Compounding  
  
 
(a)  Highest  Rate  Applicable:  For  the  purpose  of  computing  overtime 
compensation  under  this  Article,  if  more  than  one  of  the  provisions  of  this 
Agreement  with  regard  to  the  payment  of  overtime  compensation  shall  be 
applicable to any time worked by any Employee, he shall be paid for such time at 
the  highest  overtime rate specified in any of such applicable provisions but he 
shall not be entitled to additional overtime compensation for such time under any 
other of such provisions. 
  
 
(b)  Holiday Liability: Hours compensated for at overtime rates shall not be 
counted further for any purpose in determining overtime liability under the same 
or  any-other provisions; provided, however, that a holiday, whether worked or 
not,  shall  be  counted  for  purposes  of  computing  overtime  liability  under  the 
provisions of clause (3) or (4) of Section 3(a) of this Article, and hours worked 
on a holiday shall be counted for purposes of computing overtime liability under 
the provisions of clause (1) of Section 3(a) of this Article. Except as provided in 
this  paragraph  (b),  hours  paid  for  but  not  worked  shall  not  be  counted  in 
determining overtime liability.  
  
 
  
  The  following  provisions  shall  apply  in  the  computation  of  overtime 
compensation under this Agreement:  
  
 
  

Section 5. Overtime Compensation Computation  

(a)  The term "regular rate of pay" shall mean  

(2) 

(1)  Nonincentive:  in  the  case  of  an  Employee  who  shall  be  paid  at  a 

 
fixed rate of pay per hour, such rate of pay; or  
  
Incentive Basis: in the case of an Employee who shall be paid on 
 
any incentive basis, the amount of his average rate of earnings per hour on 
the  position  on  which  he  shall  work  the  particular  overtime  for  the  payroll 
week  (or  for  the  other  period  for  which  such  earnings  are  regularly 
computed) during which such overtime shall be worked; provided, however, 
that if he works on a position for which it is the regular practice to compute 
such average rate of earnings for the position as such, such average rate shall 
continue to be computed on that basis for the purposes of this paragraph; and 
provided,  further,  that  overtime  compensation  and  shift  and  Sunday 
premiums shall not be included in computing such average rate of earnings 
per  hour,  but  any  shift  premium  to  which  such  Employee  shall  be entitled 
under Article VI of this Agreement for the overtime hours worked shall be 
added to such average rate of earnings per hour in computing such regular 
rate of pay.  

(c)  Computation of Days Worked: 

representative 

from  his  office  will  notify 

Section 6. Recall Employees or Work Overtime  

  
 
(b)  A payroll week means a period of 7 successive days (of 24 hours each) 
beginning at 12:01 a.m. Sunday or at the turn-changing time nearest thereto; and 
a  workday  means  the  24-hour  period  beginning  with  the  time  the  Employee 
begins  work,  except  that  the  workday  of  an  Employee  who  reports  late  shall 
begin at the time it would have begun had he not reported late.  
  
In computing the number of workdays 
 
in which an Employee has worked for the purposes of this Section:  (1) if a shift 
includes a part of each of 2 workdays, an Employee who works on that shift shall 
be deemed to have worked only on the first of such days; (2) if an Employee 
works beyond the end of his scheduled shift into the next succeeding workday, 
he shall not be deemed to have worked on such succeeding day, unless he shall 
work more than I hours on that day or shall have been called back to work on 
that  day  after  leaving  the  Plant;  (3)  if  an  Employee  begins  work  before  the 
regular starting time of his shift and the time at which he so begins work falls 
within the workday preceding the workday on which such shift so starts and he 
has not previously worked on such preceding day, it shall not be counted as a day 
worked by him unless he shall have worked at least 4 hours on that day. 
  
 
  
  When Employees qualified to perform the work could be recalled from layoff 
because it is reasonably foreseeable that there will be work for such Employees 
for a period of two or more weeks, then the superintendent of the department or a 
designated 
the  appropriate 
representative of the Union for the department if he decides to have such work 
performed on an overtime basis instead of recalling Employees. Upon the request 
of  the  appropriate  Union  representative,  the  superintendent  or  a  designated 
representative  from  his  office  will  discuss  with  the  Union  representative  the 
reason  for  his  decision  and  any  suggested  alternative.  Such  discussion  will 
constitute  full  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  provision,  without 
prejudice to any other rights which may exist under any other provision of the 
Agreement. 
  
 
  
 
If an Employee shall be required by the Management to report  for work on 
any day and he shall report at the time and place at which he was required so to 
report, he shall be paid a minimum of 4 hours' pay at the standard hourly wage 
rate set forth in Appendix 2 which would have been applicable had he worked 
such  4  hours in the position for which he was required so to report. When an 
Employee who starts to work is released from duty before he works a minimum 
of 4 hours, he shall be paid for the hours worked by him in accordance with the 
provisions of Article IV hereof and credited with an amount equal to the standard 
hourly  wage  rate  which  would  have  been  applicable  had  he  worked  in  the 
position  for  which  he  was  scheduled  or  notified  to  report  multiplied  by  the

position  for  which  he  was  scheduled  or  notified  to  report  multiplied  by  the 
unutilized  portion  of  the  4-hour  minimum.  Any  pay  under  this  Section  shall 
include any applicable overtime, shift and Sunday premium (computed solely on 
the basis of the standard hourly wage rate). The provisions of this Section shall 
not apply to an Employee if 
  
 
at his own request or because of his own fault, he shall not be put to 
work or shall not complete 4 hours of such work after having been put to work, 
or  
  

 
(b)  he shall be assigned to another position of at least equal job class which 
he  shall  be  qualified  to  fill  and  shall  refuse  to  work  at  such  other  position  or 
because of his own fault shall not complete 4 hours of such work after having 
been put to work at such position, or  
  
  
(c)  he shall not be put to work or shall not complete 4 hours of work after 
having been put to work by reason of any strike or other stoppage of work in 
connection with any labor dispute or any failure of utilities beyond the control of 
Management or Act of God.  
 
 
 
 

ARTICLE VIII (cid:190)HOLIDAYS 

Section 1. Holidays 

  

 
  

Whenever  used  in  this  Agreement,  the  term  "holiday"  means  one  of  the 
following  days:  January  1,  Washington's  Birthday  (which  shall  be  the  third 
Monday in February), April 28 (Workers Memorial Day), Memorial Day (which 
shall be the last Monday in May), July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, the day 
following Thanksgiving Day, the day preceding Christmas and Christmas Day, 
and one Floating Holiday in each of the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 
(the local parties shall agree on which day the Floating Holiday shall be observed 
by not later than October 1 of the preceding year). If any of such holidays shall 
fall on a Sunday, the following Monday (and not such Sunday) shall be observed 
as such holiday. The local parties may agree to observe any one of the foregoing 
holidays  on  a  date  other  than  that  designated,  provided  agreement  as  to  the 
holiday and the alternate observance date for that holiday is reached by not later 
than October 1 of the preceding year.  
  
 
  
  An eligible Employee who does not work on a holiday shall be paid 8 
times the employee's applicable vacation straight time rate, as calculated 
under the provisions of Article IX, Section 6(a); provided, however, that if

an eligible employee does not have an established vacation rate he shall 
be paid 8 times his average hourly earnings exclusive of shift, Sunday 
and overtime premiums for-the lost pay period worked prior to the 
holiday. if an eligible Employee is scheduled to work on any such holiday, 
but fails to report and perform his scheduled or assigned work, he shall 
become ineligible to be paid for the unworked holiday, unless he has 
failed to perform such work because of sickness or because of death in 
the immediate family (mother, father (including in-laws), children, 
brother, sister, husband, wife and grandparents) or because of similar 
good cause. As used in this Article, an eligible Employee is one who 
  

 

(1)  has worked 30 turns since his last hire;  

 
(2)  performs  work  or  is  on  vacation  in  the  pay  period  in  which  the 
holiday is observed (or where there are weekly pay periods, the pay period in 
which  the  holiday  is  observed  or  the  next  preceding  pay  period)  or  is  on 
layoff in the pay period in which the holiday is observed but performed work 
or  was  on  vacation  in  both  the  pay  period  (2  pay  periods  in  the  case  of 
weekly  pay  periods)  immediately  preceding  and  the  pay  period  (2  pay 
periods  in  the  case  of  weekly  pay  periods)  immediately  following  the  pay 
period in which the holiday is observed; and  
  
 
(3)  works as scheduled or assigned both on his last scheduled workday 
prior  to  and  his  first  scheduled  workday  following  the  day  on  which  the 
holiday is observed, unless he has failed so to work because of sickness or 
because of death in the immediate family or because of similar good cause.  

  

  
 

Section 3. Vacation and Holiday Pay  

  
 
(a)  Eligible  Employee  on  Vacation:  An  eligible  Employee  who  would 
otherwise be entitled to pay for an unworked holiday and who shall be scheduled 
pursuant to the provisions of Article IX to take a vacation during a period when a 
holiday occurs shall be paid for the unworked holiday in addition to his vacation 
pay. The provisions of clause (3) of Section 2 of this Article shall not apply to a 
day on which an Employee is scheduled on vacation.  
  
 
(b)  Vacation-Layoff-Holiday  Pay:  The  provisions  of  paragraph  (a)  shall 
apply to (1) an Employee whose vacation has been scheduled prior to his layoff 
and  who  thereafter  is  laid  off  and  takes  his  vacation  as  scheduled,  or  (2)  an 
Employee  who  is  not  at  work  at  the  time  his  vacation  is  scheduled,  but  who 
thereafter returns to work and then is absent from work during a holiday week 
because of his scheduled vacation. An Employee who is not at work at the time 
of  scheduling  his  vacation  and  is  not  working  at  the  time  his  vacation 
commences  is  not  eligible  for  holiday  pay  for  a  holiday  occurring  during  his 
vacation within the meaning of Section 2 or 3 of this Article.

Section 2. Employee Eligibility  

To  be  eligible  for  a  vacation  in  any  calendar  year  during  the  term  of  this 

 

(a)  have one year or more of continuous service and  

  

 
(b)  have  worked  at  least  520  hours  in  the  preceding  calendar  year; 
provided, that an Employee with more than one year of continuous service 
who, in any year, shall be ineligible for a vacation by reason of the provisions 
of this paragraph as a result of an absence on account of layoff or illness shall 
receive one week's vacation with pay in such year if he shall have worked at 
least 520, hours or more in that calendar year. If an Employee worked during 
part  of  the  preceding  calendar  year  he  shall  be  deemed,  for  purposes  of 
vacation  eligibility  requirements,  to  have  worked  during  any  part  of  the 
balance  of  such  year  during  which  he  was  absent  on  account  of  an 
occupational  disability  or  while  in  military  service  in  the  year  of  his 
reinstatement to employment.  

Section 3. Continuous Service  

  
  An Employee, even though otherwise eligible under this Article, forfeits the 
right  to  receive  vacation  benefits  under  this  Article  if  he  quits,  retires,  or  is 
discharged prior to January 1 of the vacation year.  
  
 
  
 
For the purposes of this Article, continuous service shall date from: (a) the 
date of first employment at the Plant (in the case of transferred Employees from 
any Plant listed in Appendix 1, the date shall be the date of first employment at 
the Plant from which first transferred); or (b) a subsequent date of employment 
following a break in continuous service, whichever of the above two dates is the 
later.  Such  continuous  service  shall  be  computed  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of Section 2 and Section 3 of Article X of this Agreement, except that 
there shall be no accumulation of service in excess of the first two years of any 
continuous period of absence on account of layoff or physical disability (except, 
in the case of compensable disability, as provided in Section 3(c) of Article X-
Seniority) in the calculation of service for vacation eligibility.  

  
 
  
 
  

  

  

  

  

  

Section 4. Scheduling of Vacations* 

(a)  General  

 
(1)  October  1  Preferences:  On  or  promptly  after  October  1  of  each 
year, each Employee entitled or expected to become entitled to take vacation 
time off in the following year will be requested to specify in writing (not later 
than 30 days after the receipt of such request), on a form provided by the 
Company, the vacation period or periods he desires.  

 
(2)  Vacation Notice: Notice will be given an Employee at least 60 days 
in advance of the date his vacation period is scheduled to start, but in any 
event not later than January 1 of the year in which the vacation is to be taken.  

 
(3)  Allocation  of  Vacation  Periods:  Vacations  will,  so  far  as 
practicable,  be  granted  at  times  most  desired  by  Employees  (Employees 
having longer service at the Plant being given preference as to choice); but 
the  final  right  to  allot  vacation  periods  and  to  change  such  allotments  is 
exclusively reserved to the Company in order to insure the orderly operation 
of the Plants.  

 
(4)  Vacation Schedules-Absent Employees: Any Employee absent from 
work because of layoff, disability or leave of absence at the time Employees 
are  requested  to  specify  the  vacation  periods  they  desire  and  who  has  not 
previously  requested  and  been  allotted  a  vacation  period  for  the  calendar 
year, may be notified by Management that a period is being allotted as his 
vacation period but that he has the right within 14 days to request some other 
vacation  period.  If  any  such  Employee  notifies  Management  in  writing, 
within 14 days after such notice is sent, that he desires some other vacation 
period, he shall be entitled to have his vacation scheduled in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 4(a) (3) above.  

 
(5)  Vacation in Lieu of Layoff:   If an Employee is on layoff from the 
Plant at any time before the beginning of his scheduled vacation hereunder, 
he may request to have his vacation start at any time during such layoff and if 
Management  agrees  to  grant  his  request,  it  shall  have  the  right  to  set  the 
appropriate conditions under which it grants his request.  

 
(6)  Vacation  Schedules-Transferred  Employees:  Where  an  Employee 
transfers from one seniority unit to another subsequent to January 1 in any 
given  year,  he  shall  take  his  vacation  in  accordance  with  the  schedule 
established in his old seniority unit except as orderly operations of his new

established in his old seniority unit except as orderly operations of his new 
seniority  unit  preclude  it.  He  shall  not  be  entitled  to  have  any  vacation 
schedule previously established in his new seniority unit changed because of 
his  entry  into  that  unit;  should  there  be  a  conflict  between  the  transferred 
Employee and in Employee in the unit, the Employee in the unit shall retain 
his  preference  in  competition  with  the  transferred  Employee  regardless  of 
continuous service. 

(b)  Vacation Schedules  

(1)  Vacation Scheduling Period: Vacations provided under this Article 

 
may be scheduled throughout the calendar year.  

 
(2)  Pay in lieu of Vacation: The Company may, with the consent of the 
Employee, pay him vacation allowance, in lieu of time off for vacation, for 
any weeks of regular vacation in excess of two weeks in any one calendar 
year.  

(3)  Calendar  Week  Containing  New  Year's  Day:  The  calendar  week 
 
containing New Year's Day may be taken as a week of vacation for either the 
year preceding New Year's Day or the year in which New Year's Day falls, 
except when New Year's Day falls on Sunday, provided such vacation week 
has  been  scheduled  as  vacation  in  accordance  with  this  Section.  If  the 
Company in its sole discretion schedules a shutdown of any operation during 
the  calendar  week  containing  Christmas  Day,  any  Employee  who  is  not 
scheduled to work due to the shutdown in such week and who has completed 
his  vacation  entitlement  for  that  year  may  elect  to  reschedule  a  week  of 
regular vacation for which the Employee has qualified and will be entitled in 
the following calendar year into the shutdown week; provided, however, that 
vacation  pay  for  such  vacation  week,  calculated  as  though  the  week  were 
scheduled  and  taken  in  the  next  following  year  will  be  paid  on  the  regular 
payday for the pay period in which the shutdown vacation falls; and provided 
further that no vacation pay for a vacation rescheduled hereunder will be paid 
to an Employee who quits, retires, dies or is discharged prior to January 1 of 
the  year  from  which  the  shutdown  vacation  was  rescheduled.  In  the 
application  of  this  Section  4(b)(3),  when  the  basis  for  calculation  of  an 
Employee's vacation pay for the following calendar year is not available, his 
vacation payment hereunder shall be made on the basis for calculation of his 
vacation pay in the current calendar year with appropriate  adjustment to be 
made when the basis for the following calendar year becomes available.  

 
(c)  Vacation Pay Advance: If an Employee makes a written request for 
payment of his vacation allowance at least two weeks in advance of the time 
he  is  scheduled  to  take  such  vacation,  he  will  receive  the  estimated  net 
amount due him for such vacation period not later than the Friday before he 
takes the vacation

Grievances  
  
 
(a)  Procedure: It is recognized that the parties locally have the burden of 
resolving disputes relating to the scheduling of individual vacations pursuant to 
Section 4 of this Article. Should they be unable to do so, any such dispute must 
be submitted as a complaint in Step No. 1 not later than 15 days after notification 
of  the  scheduled  vacation  (or  changed  scheduled  vacation)  is  given  to  the 
Employee.  
  
 
Such complaint or grievance must be handled in the complaint and grievance 
procedure  in  order that: the Step No. 3 meeting is held and a draft of minutes 
prepared  not  later  than  80  days  prior  to  the  starting  date  of  the  scheduled 
vacation; the Step No. 4 meeting is held and a draft of minutes prepared not later 
than  70  days  prior  to  the  start  of  the  scheduled  vacation;  and,  if  necessary,  a 
decision  in  arbitration  is  issued  by  the  earlier  of  (1)  30  days  prior  to  the 
scheduled starting date of the vacation, or (2) 30 days prior to the starting date 
requested by the Employee, except that:  
  

(1) 

 
Time  Limits—Employee  Date:  In  the  event  the  Employee  is 
seeking a vacation starting earlier than that scheduled by the Company, 
the  time  limits  described  above  shall  be  applied  to  the  starting  date 
requested by the Employee;  

(2) 

 
Notice  of  Starting  Date—100  Days:  If  the  period  between 
notice to the Employee and the starting date of the vacation is less than 
100 days, the time limit set out above shall be reduced by the number of 
days by which such period is less than 100 days; and  

  

  

(3) 

 
Untimely Complaint or Grievance: Failure to meet any of the 
time limits set forth above shall not affect the Company's right to require 
the Employee to take the vacation as scheduled by the Company unless 
such failure is the fault of the Company.  

  
 
(b)  Vacation Schedules and Operations: In the resolution of complaints or 
grievances presented under this Section, the Company's determination as to the 
scheduling  required  to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  operations  shall  be 
evaluated on the same basis as heretofore.  
  
 
  
 
(a)  Rate Calculation: Each Employee granted a vacation under this Article 
will  be  paid  at  his  average  straight  time  rate  (standard  hourly  wage  rate plus 
incentive)  for  the  prior  calendar  year.  The  average  straight  time  rate  (for  the 
purposes of this Section) shall be computed by:

premium  for  overtime,  holiday,  Sunday  and  shift  differential),  (b) 
vacation pay, including pay in lieu of vacation, and (c) pay for unworked 
holidays, and  

 
(2)  Dividing  such  earnings  by  the  total  of  (a)  hours  worked,  (b) 
vacation hours paid for, including hours for which pay in lieu of vacation 
was paid, and (c) unworked holiday hours which were paid for.  

  
 
Such average straight time rate will be adjusted to reflect intervening general 
wage  changes  and  retroactive  pay  adjustments,  if  any,  for  the  job  or  jobs 
performed or paid for.  
  
(b)  Hours Calculation: Hours of vacation pay for each vacation week shall 
 
be  the  average  hours  per  week  worked  by  the  Employee  in  the  prior  calendar 
year. Any weeks not having 32 hours of actual work shall be excluded from the 
calculation. Average hours per week worked shall be computed by:  
  

(1)  Totaling  the  following  hours  in  payroll  weeks  with  32  or  more 

 
hours of actual work:  

  

  

  

  

 
 

(a)  Hours worked 
(b)  Hours  paid  for  unworked  holiday  or  vacation  hours  falling  in 

such week  

(c)  Hours paid for funeral leave 
(d)  Hours paid for jury service  
(e)  Hours paid for witness service 
(f)  Hours excused from scheduled work and not paid for because of 

 
 
 
 
Union business  

(2)  Dividing such hours by the number of such weeks in which 32 or 

 
more hours were worked.  

The minimum number of hours paid for each week of vacation shall be 40 

  
 
and the maximum number of hours paid for each week of vacation shall be 48.  
  
  Any Employee who did not work in the prior year shall have his vacation pay 
computed on the basis of his last calculated vacation rate and hours, adjusted in 
accordance with the last sentence of paragraph (a) above.  
  
 
exclusively for the purpose of calculating vacation pay.

their mutual objective is to afford maximum opportunity to afford the Employees 
to  obtain  their  vacations  and  to  attain  maximum  production.  All  Employees 
eligible for vacation shall be granted their vacation from work except as provided 
in Section 4(b)(2).

  Effective August 1, 2001, a vacation bonus of two hundred fifty dollars 
($250.00) per week will be paid to employees for each week of vacation taken 
in  the  ten  (10)  consecutive  week  period  beginning  with  the  first  full  week 
following the week containing New Year's Day.

ARTICLE X (cid:190) SENIORITY 

Section 1. Factors Affecting  

  
 
  
  Except  where  a  local  seniority  agreement  provides  for  some  greater 
measure  of  service  length  than  Plant  continuous  service,  Plant  continuous 
service shall be used for all purposes in which a measure of continuous service 
is utilized.  
  
 
In  the  promotion  of  Employees  to  non-supervisory positions and for the 
purpose  of  demotions,  or  layoffs  in  connection  with  the  decreasing  of  the 
working  force  and  of  the  recalling  to  work  of  Employees  so  laid  off,  the 
following  factors  shall  be  considered,  and  if  factors (b) and (c) are relatively 
equal, length of continuous service shall govern:  
  

10.00.00 
  
10.01.00 
  
10.01.01 

  
10.01.02

10.01.04 
  
10.01.05 
  
10.01.06 

 
  
 
  
 

(a)  Length of continuous service;  

(b )  Ability to perform the work; and  

(c)  Physical fitness.  

  
  Filling A temporary Vacancy: In the filling of a temporary vacancy within 
a  seniority  unit,  the  Management  shall,  to  the  greatest  degree  that  shall  be 
consistent with efficiency of the operation and the safety of Employees, fill the 

vacancy  with  the  Employee,  in  the  seniority unit or on the particular turn in 
such  unit  in  which  the  vacancy  shall  occur,  having  the  greatest  length  of 
continuous service.  
  
  Temporary  Vacancy(cid:190)3  or  More  Weeks'  Duration:  In  the  filling  of  a 
temporary vacancy known to be of 3 or more weeks' duration, the Management 
shall,  to  the  greatest  degree  that  shall  be  consistent  with  efficiency  of  the 
operation and the safety of Employees, fill the vacancy with the Employee in 
the  seniority  unit  having  the  greatest  length  of  continuous  service,  at  the 
earliest date on which such Employee can be so assigned without payment of 
overtime;  provided,  however,  that  for  purposes  of  this  provision  the  parties 
may  hereafter  agree  locally  upon  a  period  other  than  the  3  weeks  specified 
above.  Existing  local  agreements  or  practices  applicable  to  temporary 
vacancies of less than 3 weeks' duration shall be retained, except as they may 
hereafter be modified by local agreement.  

  

Section 2. Continuous Service  

 
  
 
(a)  Starting  Date-Break  In: Subject to the provisions of Section 3 and 
Section 6 of this Article and the provisions of Article XV hereof, the length of 
continuous service of an Employee shall be computed from the date on which 
he  first  began  work  at  the  Plant,  except  that  such  length  of  service  shall  be 
broken and no prior period or periods of employment shall be counted  
  

 

(1) 

if he shall voluntarily quit his employment; 

  

  

(3) 

(2) 

if he shall be discharged;  

 
  
 
if his employment shall  be terminated by the Company, because 
he  shall  have  been  absent  from  work  for  10  days  or  more  without 
reasonable cause (notice of which shall be given to the Local Union at least 
48 hours prior to the termination) or because he shall have failed without 
such  cause  promptly  to  return  to  work  after  a  leave  of  absence  or  when 
recalled to work after a layoff;  

if he shall be absent due to layoff or disability beyond the period 

(4) 

 
specified in Section 3 below; or  
  
 
provisions of Article XVIII or Section 13 of this Article.  

(5) 

if  his  length  of  service  shall  be  broken  in  accordance  with  the 

Section 3. Continuous Service  

  
 
  
 
(a)  Continuation When Absent: Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) 
below, if an Employee is absent from the Plant because of layoff or physical 
disability,  he  shall  continue  to  accumulate  continuous  service  during  such 
absence for two years, and for an additional period equal to (i) three years, or

absence for two years, and for an additional period equal to (i) three years, or 
(ii) the excess, if any, of his length of continuous service at commencement of 
such absence over two years, whichever is less. Any accumulation in excess of 
two years during such absence shall be counted, however, only for purposes of 
this  Article,  including  local  agreements  thereunder, and shall not be counted 
for any other purpose under this or any other agreement between the Company 
and  the  International  Union.  In  order  to  avoid  a  break  in  service  within  the 
above  period  after  an  absence  in  excess  of  two  years,  an  Employee  absent 
because  of  layoff  or  physical  disability  must  report  for  work  promptly  upon 
termination of either cause, provided, in the case of layoff, the Company has 
mailed  a  recall  notice  to  the  last  address  furnished  to  the  Company  by  the 
Employee.  
  
(b)  Absence(cid:190)Non-Occupational  Disability:  The  length  of  continuous 
 
service of an Employee who was unable to work because of non-occupational 
disability  and  who  returned  to  work  prior  to  January  4,  1960,  shall  not  be 
deemed to have been broken on account of such absence but the excess of his 
period of absence over 6 months shall not be included as a part of his length of 
continuous service.  
  
(c)  Absence(cid:190)Compensable  Disability:  Absence  due  to  a  compensable 
 
disability incurred during the course of employment shall not break continuous 
service, provided such individual is returned to work within 30 days after final 
payment of statutory compensation for such disability or after the end of the 
period used in calculating a lump sum payment. (See Appendix 28, paragraph 
11)  
  
 
  
 
In computing the length of continuous service of an Employee at a Plant, if 
such Plant shall have been acquired by the Company, there shall be included 
the  period  of  continuous service of such Employee at such Plant prior to its 
acquisition by the Company.  
  
 
  
  An  Employee  who  has  attained  a  higher  position  than  other  Employees 
through the failure of such other Employees to accept promotions shall have a 
higher  seniority  standing  than  such  other  Employees  for  the  purpose  of  the 
provisions set forth in Section 1 of this Article relating to promotions.  
  
 
  
  A  new  Employee  and  one  who  shall  be  re-employed after a break in his 
continuous service shall not acquire any seniority until the expiration of 520 
hours of actual work following his employment and shall not receive any credit 
for continuous service during such period. For all such employees hired after

for continuous service during such period. For all such employees hired after 
August  1,  1999,  the  probationary  period  will  be  one  thousand  (1,000) 
hours.    If  he  shall  be  continued  in  the  employ  of  the  Company  after  the 
expiration  of  such  520  hours  of  actual  work,  the  length  of  his  continuous 
service shall be computed from the date of his employment or re-employment 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2, Section 3 and Section 4 of this 
Article. During the first 520  [or one thousand(1,000)]  hours of actual work, 
he may be laid off or discharged as the Management shall determine and his 
layoff  or  discharge  shall  not  be  made  the  basis  of  any  claim,  complaint  or 
grievance  against  the  Company;  provided  that  this  will  not  be  used  for 
purposes  of  discrimination  because  of  race,  color,  religious  creed,  national 
origin, handicap, disabled veterans and veterans of the Viet Nam era, sex or 
age  (except  where  sex  or  age  is  a  bona  fide  occupational  qualification)  or 
because of membership in the Union.  
  
  Where a new Employee is relieved from work because of lack of work and 
his  employment  status  terminated  in  connection  therewith,  and  he  is 
subsequently rehired at the same Plant within one year from the date of such 
termination, the hours of actual work accumulated by such Employee during 
his first employment shall be added to the hours of actual work accumulated 
during  his  second  employment  in  determining  when  the  Employee  has 
completed  five  hundred  twenty  (520)  [or  one  thousand(1,000)]  hours  of 
actual work; provided, however, that should such an Employee complete five 
hundred  twenty  (520)  [or  one  thousand(1,000)]  hours  of  actual  work  in 
accordance with this sentence, his continuous service date will be the date of 
hire of his second hiring.  

 

Seniority shall be applied in the seniority units, which may be an entire 
Plant or any subdivision thereof, as established or agreed upon. A job may be 
in  one  seniority  unit  for  one  purpose,  such  as  promotions,  and  may  be  in  a 
different  seniority  unit  for  another  purpose,  such  as  layoffs.  The  existing 
seniority unit or units and departments to which the seniority factors shall be 
applied  and  the  rules  for  application  of  the  seniority  factors,  covered  by 
existing  local  agreements,  shall  remain  in  effect  unless  or  until  modified  by 
local written agreement signed by the Superintendent of Labor Relations and 

Section 7. Breaking Ties  

  
 
If,  however,  such  an  Employee  is  rehired  within  two  weeks  of  his  last 
termination from employment at the same plant, his continuous service date 
will be the date of hire for his prior employment.  
  
 
  
  The  Grievance  Committee  and  Management  shall  establish  rules  (where 
such  rules  do  not  exist)  for  breaking  ties  where  Employees  have  the  same 
continuous service dates.

local written agreement signed by the Superintendent of Labor Relations and 
the  chairman  and  secretary  of  the  Grievance  Committee.  Local  seniority 
agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall be consistent with 
Appendix 38. Hereafter all future local seniority agreements shall provide that: 
all promotions (including step ups), decreases in forces (including demotions 
and layoffs), recalls after layoff and other practices affected by seniority shall 
be in accordance with Plant service provided that, (a) demotions,  layoffs and 
other  reductions  in  force  shall  be  made  in  descending  job  sequence  order 
starting  with  the  highest  affected  job  and  with  the  Employee  on  such  job 
having the least length of Plant continuous service, and (b) the sequence on a 
recall shall be made in the reverse order so that the same Employees return to 
jobs in the same positions relative to one another that existed prior to the force 
reductions. Future local agreements may provide for a procedure varying from 
the foregoing upon joint approval by designated officials of the Company and 
the  International  Union.  Hereafter  local  seniority  agreements,  including 
agreements covering departments or units thereof, shall be signed on behalf of 
the Union by the chairman and secretary of the Grievance Committee and shall 
be posted in the Plant. 
  
  New Jobs: In any case in which local agreement cannot be consummated as 
to the seniority units in which a new job or new jobs, including those in new, 
merged or transferred operations, are to be placed, or the rules for application 
of the seniority factors to such jobs (including the appropriate progression and 
regression structure), Management shall include such job or jobs in the most 
appropriate  seniority  unit  or,  if  more  appropriate,  establish  a  new  seniority 
unit,  and  establish  rules  for  application  of  the  seniority  factors  to  such  jobs 
(including  its  determination  of  the  appropriate  progression  and  regression 
structure), subject to the grievance procedure of this Agreement.  
  
 
  
 
It  is  recognized  that  conflicting  seniority  claims  among  Employees  may 
arise when Plant or department facilities are created, expanded, added, merged, 
or discontinued, involving the possible transfer of Employees. It is agreed that 
such  claims  are  matters  for  which  adjustment  shall  be  sought  between 
Management and the appropriate grievance representatives or committees.  
  
  Failure  to  Agree:  In  the  event  the  above  procedure  does  not  result  in 
agreement,  the  International  Union  and  the  Company  may  work  out  such 
agreement  as  they  deem  appropriate  irrespective  of  existing  seniority 
agreements  or  may  submit  the  matter  to  arbitration  under  such  conditions, 
procedures, guides and stipulations as to which they may mutually agree.  
  
 
  
  Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to increase intra-plant job security 
for  longer-service  Employees.  The  application  of  seniority  provisions  other

for  longer-service  Employees.  The  application  of  seniority  provisions  other 
than those established under this Section to jobs in a seniority unit shall not be 
affected by the inclusion of such jobs in the pool except to the extent necessary 
to comply with the provisions of this Section.  
  
  Establishment of Seniority Pools: It is the objective of the parties that there 
shall  be  at  each  Plant  the  minimum  number  of  seniority  pools  as  described 
below consistent with the efficient operation of the Plant. As a minimum, the 
agreed-upon  area  covering  a  single  seniority  pool  in  each  case  shall  be  as 
broad as practicable and in no event shall be less than a major operating unit 
such  as  Blast  Furnace,  Coke  Plant,  Open  Hearth,  etc.;  however,  rolling 
facilities need not necessarily be considered as one unit but shall nevertheless 
be as broad as practicable.  
  

(a)  Pool  Composition:  Each  seniority  pool  within  an  agreed-upon 
 
area  as  established  or  revised  pursuant  to  the  above  objectives  shall  be 
regarded  as  being  a  single  seniority  pool  for  the  purposes  of  layoff  and 
recall. Each such pool shall be made up of all jobs in job Classes 1, 2, and 3 
and such jobs in job Class 4 or higher as shall be agreed upon by the local 
parties. The number of jobs in job Class 4 or higher to be included in the 
pool shall be no less than the number of all of the job Class 4 jobs in the 
agreed-upon area. The job opportunities provided by the jobs in job Class 4 
or higher included in the pool as of the pay period including the 90th day 
after the effective date of this Agreement shall be approximately equivalent 
to the job opportunities provided by all job Class 4 jobs in the agreed-upon 
area as of such date. If a particular job required to be included in the pool 
by the foregoing provisions is inappropriate for inclusion in the pool, the 
local  parties  may  agree  to  remove  it  from  the  pool-provided that another 
suitable  job  (or  jobs)  is  concurrently  added  to  the  pool  which  does  not 
reduce significantly the number of job opportunities provided by the job 
which  was  removed  from  the  pool.  The  jobs  in  the  pool  shall  also  be 
included  in  appropriate  seniority  units  for  the  application  of  seniority 
provisions other than those included in this Section. 
  
(b)  Assignment Within A Pool:  An Employee who at the time he is or 
 
otherwise  would  be  laid  off  has  two  or  more  years  of  Plant  continuous 
service shall be assigned to a job for which he is qualified in his seniority 
pool if a job in his seniority pool is held by an Employee having less Plant 
continuous service; provided, however, that the Management shall  not be 
required to assign him to any such job before the expiration of 30 days (or 
such shorter period as may have been heretofore agreed upon by the local 
parties)  after  the  date  of  his  layoff.  In  filling  other  than  temporary 
vacancies  in  jobs  in  any  seniority  pool,  the  Management  will  recall 
Employees laid off from the seniority units covered by the pool in the order 
of their Plant continuous service; however, the Employee must be qualified 
to perform the job. Where practicable, however, Management will make a 
reasonable  effort  to  assign,  on  the  basis  of  Plant  continuous  service,  an 

  
10.10.02 

  
10.10.03 

  
10.10.04 

reasonable  effort  to  assign,  on  the  basis  of  Plant  continuous  service,  an 
Employee laid off from his seniority unit to a pool job he prefers which is 
not held by an Employee of that unit. However, Management shall have the 
right, to the extent necessary, to designate the specific job in any pool to 
which an Employee shall be assigned (and to change such assignments) in 
order to provide jobs for longer-service Employees who would otherwise 
be unable to qualify for an available job in the pool. in order to maintain 
efficiency, the Management need not assign laid-off Employees to a job in 
any operating or service unit where such assignment would result in less 
than  the  required  minimum  of  experienced  Employees  in  such  unit.  The 
local parties may by agreement determine whether there are circumstances 
under which an Employee need not accept a pool job.  

(c)  Permanent Shutdowns/Extended Layoffs: In a Plant in which there 
 
is  established  more  than  one  agreed-upon  area  as  defined  above,  the 
following shall apply: In the event of a permanent shutdown of a facility as 
defined in Article XVIII or a layoff of one or more Employees for a period 
which extends for three months or more (or any lesser period which may 
be agreed to by the local parties) or  which the parties believe will extend 
for  such  a  period,  an  Employee  affected  who  has  two  or  more  years  of 
Plant continuous service at time of layoff shall be given the right to a job in 
any seniority pool in the Plant if a job in that pool is held by an Employee 
in the pool with less Plant service provided he is qualified to perform the 
job  and  has  the  necessary  qualifications  required  in  the  promotional 
sequence involved. Such assignments to jobs shall be subject to the same 
rules as apply in paragraph (b) above. An Employee who has been assigned 
to a job in a different seniority pool under this provision and who has been 
subsequently  laid  off  from  that  pool  shall  have  recall  rights  to  that  pool 
until  he  is  recalled  to  a  job  in  the  agreed-upon  area  from  which he was 
originally  laid  off;  provided,  however,  that  such  recall  rights  shall  be 
limited  to  his  own  pool  and  the  pool  from  which  he  was  laid  off;  and 
provided,  further,  that  the  Management  shall  not  be  required  under  this 
paragraph  to  displace  a  shorter-service  Employee  with  such  laid-off 
Employee before the expiration of 30 days after the date of any such layoff. 

  

  

  
(d)  Retention  Rights:  An  Employee  assigned  under  any  pool 
arrangement  to  a  seniority  unit  for  purposes  of  retention  shall  have no 
seniority rights for promotional purposes in that unit, except in competition 
with an Employee in such unit who has been employed less than 31 days 
prior to the retained Employee's assignment in that seniority unit 
  
(e)  Liability – Recall – Wrong Employee: Employees shall be recalled 
 
directly to jobs in their seniority units or promotional sequences above the 
seniority  pool,  if  that  is  in  accord  with  applicable  seniority  practices  or 
agreements. if the Company recalls the wrong Employee from a layoff to a

job in a pool, it will not be liable for any retroactive pay to the Employee 
who should have been recalled, with respect to any period prior to 4 days 
or the beginning of the payroll week, whichever is later, after receipt by the 
Company  of  specific  written  notice  by  him  (on  a  form  to  be  provided 
therefor) of its alleged error.  
  
Schedule  Changes:  If  the  local  parties  deem  it  helpful  in 
 
facilitating the assignment of Employees in the pool, they are empowered 
to  agree  in  writing  that  schedule  changes  arising  from  movements  of 
Employees into, within or out of the seniority pools in accordance with the 
provisions of this Section shall not be deemed a violation of the provisions 
relating  to  schedule  changes  or  provide  a  basis  for  a  claim  for  sixth  or 
seventh day overtime compensation or reporting allowance.

  Section 11.  Manning New Facilities  
  
 
In the manning of jobs on new facilities in the Plants, the jobs shall be 
filled by qualified Employees who apply for such jobs in the order of length of 
Plant continuous service from the following categories in the following order 
but subject to paragraph (b) below. 

(a) 

  
(1)  Displaced By Replacement Facilities: Employees displaced from 

 
any facility being replaced in the Plant by the new facilities.  

(2)  Displaced  By  New  Facilities: Employees being displaced as the 

 
result of the installation of the new facilities.  

(3)  Employed On Like Facilities: Employees presently employed on 

 
like facilities in the Plant.  

(4)  Laid  Off  From  Like  Facilities:  Employees  presently  on  layoff 

 
from like facilities in the Plant.  

  

  

  

  

(5)  Other Employees: Employees in the Plant with two or more years 
 
of Plant continuous service, provided, that if sufficient qualified applicants 
from  this  source  are  not  available,  Management  shall  fill  the  remaining 
vacancies as it deems appropriate.  

  
(b)  Type  of  Service  For  Qualification:  The  local  parties  shall  meet  to 
 
seek  agreement  on  the  standards  to  be  used  to  determine  the  qualifications 
entitling Employees otherwise eligible to be assigned to the jobs in question. 
Should  the  local  parties  fail  to  agree  on  the  standards  for  determining 
qualifications, an applicant otherwise eligible shall have:  
  

(1)  Necessary  Qualifications:  The  necessary  qualifications  for 

 
performing the job.

(2)  Ability to Absorb Training:  The ability to absorb such training for 
 
the  job  as  is  to  be  offered  and  is  necessary  to  enable  the  Employee  to 
perform the job satisfactorily.  
  
in  Sequence:  The  necessary 
 
qualifications to progress in the promotional sequence involved to the next 
higher  job  to  the  extent  that  Management  needs  Employees  for  such 
progression. In determining the necessary qualifications to advance in the 
promotional  sequence  involved,  the  normal  experience  acquired  by 
Employees in such sequence shall be taken into consideration. However, it 
is  recognized  that  Management  can  require  that  a  sufficient  number  of 
occupants of each job in a promotional sequence be available to assure an 
adequate number of qualified replacements for the next higher job.

  Alternate  Methods:  In  lieu  of  or  in  addition  to  the  foregoing,  the  local 
parties  may  develop  a  method  for  filling  permanent  vacancies  in  the  new 
facility between the time of initial manning and the final election to transfer.  
  
 
(e)  Temporary Assignment to Regular Job: Should Management deem it 
necessary to assign an Employee to his regular job on the old facility in order 
to  continue  its  efficient  operation,  it  may  do  so  on  the  basis  of  establishing 
such Employee on the new job and temporarily assigning him to his former job 
until a suitable replacement can be trained for the job or its performance is no 
longer required. In such event, such Employee shall be entitled to earnings not 

  
 
(c)  Disqualified  Applicant-Right  to  Apply:  An  applicant  who  is 
disqualified  under  paragraph  (b)(3)  above  shall  have  the  right  to  apply  for 
another job for which he believes he can qualify.  
  

 
(d)  Local Rules for Second Opportunity Transfers: When new facilities 
are to be manned pursuant to this Section, the local parties shall meet and may 
establish,  in  appropriate  circumstances,  rules  for  allowing  an  Employee  not 
placed  initially,  a  second  opportunity  to  elect  transfer  to  the  new  facility 
consistent  with  its  efficient  operation.  In  establishing  such  rules,  the  local, 
parties shall consider matters such as:  
  

(1)  Job Level in Sequence: The job level in the promotional sequence 
 
in  the  new  unit  up  to  which  an  Employee  will  be  allowed  a  second 
opportunity to elect transfer.  
  
(2)  Time  Limits  on  Second  Opportunity:  The  date  on  which  the 
 
second  opportunity  must  be  exercised  following  start-up  of  the  new 
facility, but not more than three years thereafter. (in determining such date, 
the  parties  shall  give  due  consideration 
to  possible  Management 
abandonment of the old facility or an extended period of its non-use.)

longer required. In such event, such Employee shall be entitled to earnings not 
less than what he would have made had he been working on the job on which 
he has been established.  
  
 
(f)  Facilities  at  More  Than  One  Plant:    Where  new  facilities  replace 
facilities  of  more  than  one  Plant  in  the  same  general  locality,  appropriate 
representatives  of  the  Company  and  the  International  Union  shall  meet  in 
conjunction with the local parties for the purpose of seeking an agreement on 
manning  consistent  with  the  parties'  mutual  intent  to  facilitate  efficient 
manning  and  preserve  job  security  for  longer-service  Employees.  In  such 
situations, Company service may be considered in addition to Plant service.  
  
 
Rights  
  
 
Permanent  transfers  shall  not  be  made  through  the  operation  of  the  pool 
procedures. An Employee who is assigned under a pool arrangement to a unit 
for purposes of retention shall not be able to effectuate a permanent transfer to 
that  unit  by  refusing  a  recall  to  his  home  unit.  (However,  nothing  contained 
herein shall preclude such an Employee from effectuating a permanent transfer 
by bidding for a permanent vacancy in such a unit or any other unit. Moreover, 
nothing  contained  herein  shall  affect  the  rights  of  such  Employees  under  a 
permanent  shutdown  situation.)  In  addition,  such  a  retained  Employee  shall 
have  only  such  promotional  rights  in  the  unit  to  which  he  is  assigned  for 
retention purposes as are provided for by Section 10(d). 
  
 
(a)  Subject to the exception provided by paragraph (c) below for entry 
into Trades and Crafts, a three-step procedure for filling permanent vacancies 
shall be retained as presently agreed to. A permanent vacancy shall be filled 
from  within  the  first  step  of  competition  (whether  it  be  unit,  line  of 
progression, etc.). Each succeeding vacancy shall be filled in the same manner, 
and the resulting vacancy in the entry level job shall thereafter be filled on a 
departmental basis (the second step of competition) by Employees who have 
satisfactorily completed their probationary periods (for employees hired on or 
after  August  1,  1999,  six  months  of  plant  service  or  the  end  of  such 
employees' probationary period, whichever is later) on the date the vacancy 
is  posted  or  such  lesser  period  as  has  been  mutually  agreed  to  by  the  local 
parties. Resulting entry level departmental vacancies shall be filled on a Plant-
wide  basis  (the  third  step  of  competition)  by  Employees  who  have 
satisfactorily completed their probationary periods (for employees hired on or 
after  August  1,  1999,  six  months  of  plant  service  or  the  end  of  such 
employees' probationary period, whichever is later) on the date the vacancy 
is  posted  or  such  lesser  period  as  has  been  mutually  agreed  to  by  the  local 
parties. An Employee transferring under Article X, Section 18, shall be eligible 
to  bid  on  vacancies  notwithstanding  the  plant  service  requirement  set  forth 
above.  

  
 
(b)  However,  in  Plants  where  operating  circumstances  so  warrant (such 
as  size,  geography,  job  relationships,  physical  proximity,  safety,  and  other 
appropriate factors), a two-step procedure for filling permanent vacancies shall 
be retained as presently agreed to. Under a two-step procedure, a permanent 
vacancy shall be filled from within the first step of competition (whether it be 
unit, line of progression, department, etc.). Each succeeding vacancy shall be 
filled in the same manner and the resulting vacancy in the entry level job shall 
thereafter be filled on a Plant-wide basis by Employees with at least 6 months 
of Plant service (for employees hired on or after August 1, 1999, six months 
of  plant  service  or  the  end  of  such  employees'  probationary  period, 
whichever is later)  on the date the vacancy is posted or such lesser period as 
has been mutually agreed to by the local parties.  
  
(c)  As an exception to the procedures for filling vacancies provided for 
 
by  paragraph  (a)  above,  all  permanent  vacancies  in  apprenticeships  and  in 
entry level jobs in lines of promotion containing occupations which in fact lead 
to craft jobs shall be filled on a Plant-wide basis from among qualified bidding 
Employees.  Similarly,  permanent  vacancies  in  craft  jobs  which  are  not  filled 
by  the  promotion  or  assignment  of  apprenticeship  graduates,  or  by  the 
promotion of an Employee from a non-craft job in a line of promotion leading 
to a craft job, or by the transfer of a craft Employee from one unit to another 
within  the  same  Trade  or  Craft  shall  be  filled  on  a  Plant-wide  basis  from 
among  qualified  bidding  Employees.  An  Employee  shall  not  be  disqualified 
for bidding on any such vacancy by reason of any minimum length of service 
requirement. Should Management deem it necessary to retain an Employee on 
his former job in order to continue efficient operation, it may do so on the basis 
of establishing such Employee on the new job and temporarily assigning him 
to his former job until a suitable replacement can be trained for the job or its 
performance  is  no  longer  required.  In  such  event,  such  Employee  shall  be 
entitled  to  earnings  not  less  than  what  he  would  have  made  had  he  been 
working  on  the  new  job  on  which  he  has  been  established  and,  where 
applicable,  shall  be  paid  as  though  such  hours  were  credited  to  any 
apprenticeship. 
  
 
factors set forth in Section 1 of this Article subject to the following:  
  

(d)  Vacancies  shall  be  made  available  in  accordance  with  the  seniority 

(1)  Qualified to Perform: An Employee must be qualified to perform 

 
the job.  
  
 
(2)  With respect to entry level jobs classified at job Class 5 and below 
that  are  filled  on  a  departmental  or  plant-wide  basis,  such  jobs  shall  be 
filled from among qualified bidding Employees in order of length of plant 
continuous service, subject, however, to paragraph (3) below.

(3)  Qualified  to  Progress  in  Sequence:  With  respect  to  jobs  in 
promotional  sequences  leading  to  Trade  or  Craft  or  special-purpose 
maintenance  jobs  or  to  highly  skilled  operating  or  technical  jobs, 
Management may require an Employee to have the necessary qualifications 
to progress in the promotional sequence involved to the next higher job to 
the  extent  that  Management  needs  Employees  for  such  progression.  In 
determining  the  necessary  qualifications  to  advance  in  the  promotional 
sequence involved, the normal experience acquired by Employees in such 
sequence shall be taken into consideration. However, it is recognized that 
Management can require that a sufficient number of occupants of each job 
in  a  promotional sequence be available to assure an adequate number of 
qualified replacements for the next higher job.  

  
 
(e)  Results of Transfer:  An Employee who transfers under this Section 
shall have the right to voluntarily return to the unit from which he transferred 
within a 30-calendar day period commencing from the date of his transfer or 
Management may, within the same period, return him to that unit because he 
cannot  fulfill  the  requirements  of  the  job.  In  either  event,  his  return  to  his 
former  unit  within  such  30-calendar  day  period  shall  be  without  loss  of 
seniority standing in such unit. In the event an Employee voluntarily returns to 
the  unit  from  which  he  transferred,  such  Employee  shall  not  be  eligible  for 
transfer for twelve months following his return.  
  

 
(1)  An Employee who bids and prevails under a plant-wide posting of 
a job vacancy and accepts the transfer to that vacancy shall not be eligible 
to bid on any other plant-wide job vacancy posting during the next twelve 
months  following  that  transfer  unless  he  is  displaced  from  the  new  unit 
transferred to by a reduction in force or other cause.  
  
 
(2)  An  Employee  who  bids  and  prevails  on  either  a  plant-wide  or 
department-wide posting of a job vacancy and declines the transfer to that 
vacancy, shall not be eligible to bid on any other posting of a vacancy in 
the unit to which the transfer was declined during-the next twelve months 
following that event.  

  

 
(3)  Sub-paragraphs  (1)  and  (2)  above  shall  not  apply  to  plant-wide 
postings of permanent vacancies in apprenticeships or in entry level jobs in 
lines of promotion containing occupations which in fact lead to craft jobs. 
However, they shall apply to plant-wide postings of permanent vacancies in 
journeyman trade or craft jobs.  

  
 
(f)  Where a job sequence or line of progression includes jobs in the pool, 
such pool jobs in that job sequence or line of progression shall be considered 
as a single job in filling permanent vacancies above the pool.

  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  Section  2  and  Section  6  of  this  Article,  the 
following  provisions  shall  apply  in  respect  of  transfers  of  Employees  within 
any Plant:  
  

(a)  Employee Transfer(cid:190)Not Requested: If an Employee has been or 
 
shall be transferred from one seniority unit to another seniority unit other 
than at his own request; he shall retain and continue to accumulate seniority 
rights in the seniority unit from which he was or shall be transferred for a 
period  of  not  longer  than  6  months  or  for  such  other  period  as  shall  be 
agreed upon by the Management and the Grievance Committee.  

 
(b)  Promotion to Supervisory Position: If an Employee has been or 
shall be promoted to a supervisory position, he shall retain and continue to 
accumulate seniority rights in the seniority unit from which he was or shall 
be so promoted.  

 
(c)  Assignment of Disabled Employees: If an Employee (1) who was 
or  shall  be  disabled  while  in  military  service  and  was  or  shall  be  re-
employed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  XV  of  this 
Agreement  or  (2)  who  was  or  shall  be  disabled  in  the  course  of  his 
employment with the Company, was or shall be transferred by agreement 
between the Management and the Grievance Committee from one seniority 
unit  to  another  to  accomplish  his  rehabilitation  or  to  restore  him,  after  a 
period  of  rehabilitation  deemed  reasonable  by  the  Company's  medical 
department, to the seniority unit from which he shall originally have been 
transferred,  he  may,  by  agreement  between  the  Management  and  the 
Grievance Committee, carry with him his total accumulated seniority rights 
in any and all seniority units from which he shall be so transferred.  

(d)  Furnish  Return  Notice:  The  Management  shall  furnish  to  each 
 
Employee who shall be transferred from a seniority unit, and to his Local 
Union, a copy of the Return Notice on which shall be indicated whether the 
transfer  is  at  the  request  of  the  Employee  or  at  the  direction  of  the 
Management.  

  

  

  

  

(e)  Reemployment(cid:190)Laid-Off Employee: An Employee who shall be 
 
laid  off  from  the  Plant  and  who  thereafter  shall  be  employed  by  the 
Company  in  another  seniority  unit  shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  beep 
transferred for the purposes of this Section and Section 12 of this Article.

Financial Secretary and Treasurer of the Local or Locals of the Union at any 
Plant shall, for their respective terms of office, have top seniority rights in the 
area  within  the  Plant  which  they  represent  for  the  purposes  of  layoffs  in 
connection with the decreasing of the working forces in such area; provided, 
however, that a Grievance Committeeman or an officer of a Local of the Union 
shall not be retained in the employ of the Company unless work which he can 
perform is available in such area. Notwithstanding the provisions of any local 
seniority agreement, retention at work in accordance with this Section shall not 
enable any such Employee to claim relative seniority status in excess of that 
which he otherwise would have had prior to such retention.  
  
 
(b)  Designated Union Officer:   At each Plant the District Director of the 
Union shall designate in writing to the Superintendent of Labor Relations the 
names of the Grievance Committeemen (not exceeding 10 at any Plant) who 
shall have top seniority rights in accordance with the foregoing provisions of 
this Section.  
  
(c)  Leave of Absence(cid:190)Union Officers: Any Employee having a length of 
 
continuous  service  with  the  Company  of  one  year  or  more  who  shall  be 
appointed or elected to an office in the Union at the Plant at which he shall be 
employed, may, upon the written request of the Union, be granted a leave of 
absence for a period of one year. By agreement of the Company and the Union, 
such leave of absence may be extended or renewed for a further period of one 
year  or  for  such  other  period  or  periods  as  shall  be  agreed  upon.  Such 
Employee's  length  of  service  record  shall  be  computed  as  though  he  were 
continuously employed by the Company during such leave of absence.

If, as a result of a decrease in work other than decreases which may occur 
from day to day, the average scheduled hours of work of the Employees in a 
seniority unit shall be reduced for a period of 2 consecutive weeks to less than 
32 hours per week and in the judgment of the Management that level of work 
will  continue  for  an  extended  period  of  time,  the  head  of  the  department 
affected will discuss with the Grievance Committeeman in such department the 
question  whether  a  decrease  of  the  working  force  shall  be  effected  in 
accordance with the provisions of this Article or whether the available hours of 
work shall be distributed among the Employees in such unit so far as shall be 
practicable  with  due  regard  for  the  particular  skills  and  abilities  required  to 
perform  the  work  available  there.  If  the  head  of  the  department  and  such 
Grievance  Committeeman  shall  fail  to  agree,  the  working  force  in  such  unit 
shall be reduced to an extent which shall be sufficient to enable the Employees 
working there to average 32 hours of work per week.

Posting of Permanent Vacancies  

 
  
 
(a)  When a permanent vacancy in any job in a seniority unit shall occur 
which is to be filled by promotion, the Management shall, so far as shall be 
practicable, post a notice of such vacancy in the department for a period of 30 
days.  
  
(b)  A  permanent  vacancy  on  an  entry  level  job  in  department-wide 
 
competition  shall  be  brought  to  the  notice  of  all  Employees  within  the 
department  in  accordance  with  administrative  rules  presently  in  effect  or  as 
may  be  mutually  changed  by  Plant  Management  and  the  Grievance 
Committee. Where necessary such notice shall be posted and, in any event, the 
rules  developed  shall  insure  complete  and  adequate  notice  to  all  affected 
Employees of (i) the vacancies and, subsequently, (ii) the Employees selected, 
including their Plant continuous service dates.  
  
 
(c)  A permanent vacancy on an entry level job in Plant-wide competition 
shall be posted on a Plant-wide basis in accordance with administrative rules 
presently in effect or as may be mutually changed by Plant Management and 
the Grievance Committee, as to location of posting, duration of posting period, 
method  of  bidding,  period  for  selection,  notice  of  selection,  and  method  or 
procedure for contesting a selection. Such rules shall require that (i) the notice 
of vacancy posted shall indicate the department, job title, job class, estimated 
number of Employees needed, date of posting, and the time and location where 
bids can be filed for the vacancy involved, (ii) the bids shall be in writing, and 
(iii)  the  subsequent  notice  of  the  prevailing  bidders  shall  indicate their Plant 
continuous service dates.  
  
 
(d)  A  permanent  vacancy  may  be  filled  by  temporary  assignments  in 
accordance  with  applicable  seniority  agreements  until  such  time  as  the 
prevailing bidder is selected and assigned.  
  
(e)  The term entry level job -refers to the job or jobs in a seniority unit or 
 
line  of  promotion  in  which  permanent  vacancies  remain  after  all  Employees 
with incumbency status in such unit or line have exercised their promotional 
and other seniority rights.  
  
 
(f)  An  employee  temporarily  held  for  more  than  30  days  from 
assignment to any position to which he has successfully bid pursuant to the 
provisions of Article X, Sections 12 and 16 of this Agreement, shall be paid 
the  greater  of  the  earnings  applicable  to  the  job  he  is  performing  or  the 
earnings applicable to the job to which he would otherwise be assigned to as a 
result of his bid or transfer.
