AGREEMENT 

 
 
THIS  AGREEMENT,  made  and  entered  into  this  1st  day  of August 2000, by and between the United 
Automobile,  Aerospace  and  Agricultural  Implement  Workers  of  America  (UAW)  and  its  Local  Union 
1979,  hereinafter  sometimes  "Professional  and  Administrative  Union"  or  "Union,"  and  the  Board  of 
Governors of Wayne State University, the legally constituted governing body of this State institution of 
higher  learning  having  constitutional  status  under  the  1963  Constitution  of  the  State  of  Michigan, 
hereinafter sometimes "University." 
 

 PREAMBLE 

 
 
Whereas, the parties hereto recognize that the purpose of the University is to provide a facility for the 
education, training and enlightenment of all those who seek through its facilities to avail themselves of, 
and to contribute to, the learning process and 
 
Whereas,  it  is  recognized  that  the  University  undertakes  to  provide  these  services  to  the  local,  state, 
national and world communities through teaching, research and community service, and is dedicated to 
free  inquiry  and  expression,  to  the  highest  ideals  of  a  democratic  society,  and  to  the  growth  of  man 
through education and 
 
Whereas, the Professional and Administrative Union shares with the University the common objective of 
providing and maintaining an efficient and smoothly-run facility that will create an environment that will 
make possible the accomplishment of maximum learning and 
 
Whereas, the job classifications included in the Professional and Administrative Union are recognized as 
part of one of the four major academic personnel groups of the University as defined by the Board of 
Governors Proceedings, October 24, 1968, and that the job classifications within this unit exist as pertinent 
and vital for the effective functioning of the University and  
 
Whereas, the University and the Union have agreed to recognize the Union as the collective bargaining 
agency for those job classifications within Group C "Professional and Administrative Staff" and 
 
Whereas,  it  is  recognized  that  Employees  included  in  the  Professional  and  Administrative  Union 
bargaining unit are entitled to equitable and just compensation for services rendered to the University, to 
equitable and just conditions of employment, to procedures for the equitable and peaceful adjustment of 
disputes through orderly and established channels and 
 
Whereas,  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Michigan  authorize  collective  bargaining  for  public  Employees  and 
authorize public Employers to enter into collective bargaining agreements with the representatives of their 
Employees; 
 
Now,  therefore,  the parties hereto do mutually covenant, promise and agree to and with each other as 
follows: 

-1-

Excluded  from  representation  by  this  bargaining  unit  are  supervisors,  all  executives,  confidential 
employees,  administrative  employees  and  all  other  employees  covered  by  other  collective  bargaining 
agreements  at  Wayne  State  University  and  those  in  the  following  areas  effective  8/1/00:    Equal 
Opportunity; The Office of the President and Chief of Staff; Strategic Planning; the Central Budget Office; 
The Central Division of Human Resources.  Effective October 1, 2000, employees whose primary duties 
are sales or fundraising related, or employees who work for departments or units whose primary purpose 
is  development  (fundraising)  shall  be  excluded  from  the  bargaining  unit.  Furthermore,  it  is  mutually 
agreed that the following personnel are excluded from the bargaining unit.  Subject to a maximum number 
of eight (8) employees.   
 
1. 
  
2. 
 
Upon request, the Union will be provided with a list of excluded Employees. 
 
It is the policy of the University not to reduce the bargaining unit by arbitrary change in classification titles 
or  to  do  so  by  creation  of  new  classifications.    Promotions  to  positions  of  greater responsibilities may 
justify promotion to a classification outside of the bargaining unit.  The Union will be given at least a two-
week written notice prior to the implementation of such promotions. 
 

Personnel in the Office of any Vice President; 

Personnel in the Department of Internal Audit; 

 

-3- 

 
 
 
The University agrees that if any new or revised classifications are proposed covering comparable work as 
now being performed by any of the classifications in this Agreement, the University will notify the Union 
in writing at least two (2) weeks prior to the proposed implementation of the new or revised classifications 
and  meet,  upon  request,  to  determine  whether  such  classifications  should  become  a  part  of  this 
Agreement. 
 
In  no  event  shall  the  University  remove  any  existing  classifications  from  the  bargaining  unit,  nor  shall 
work currently performed by bargaining unit members be removed from the bargaining unit as a result of 
reclassification except in instances of shared work. 
 
In the event of a dispute over the inclusion of new or revised classifications into the bargaining unit, or 
exclusion  of  such  classifications  from  the  bargaining  unit,  such  dispute  shall  begin  at  Step  3  of  the 
Grievance Procedure. 
 
As the Union obtains a majority of signature cards in other classifications (appropriate to this Collective 
Bargaining Unit), the University shall recognize the Association as representing such classifications.  In the 
event of a dispute about the appropriateness of the classifications, the University and Union will meet and 
discuss the matter.  If a dispute still exists after the parties have met, the matter may be referred to the 
Michigan Employment Relations Commission for resolution.

B. 

 
C. 

 
D. 

 

The University hereby agrees that all Employees of the University, in accordance with Article 1 of 
this Agreement, shall have the right to freely organize, join and support the Union for the purpose 
of engaging in collective bargaining or negotiations and other concerted activities for mutual aid 
and  protection.    The  Employer  undertakes  and  agrees  that  it  will  not  directly  or  indirectly 
discriminate against any Employee with respect to hours, wages, or any terms or conditions of 
employment by reason of his/her membership in the Union, his/her participation in any activities 
of the Union or collective professional negotiations with the University or his/her institution of any 
grievance, complaint or proceeding under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to any terms or 
conditions  of  employment.    Any  concern  raised  by  the  Union  regarding  this  provision  of  the 
Collective Bargaining Agreement may be the subject of a Special Conference as outlined in Article 
10. of this Agreement, but shall not limit any right to refer the matter to the appropriate step of the 
Grievance Procedure. 

The Employer will not aid, promote or finance any labor group or organization which purports to 
engage  in  collective  bargaining  involving  the  Employees  covered  by  this  Agreement,  for  the 
duration of the Agreement, or any extensions thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be construed 
to prevent any individual Employee from presenting a grievance and having the grievance adjusted 
without  intervention  of  the  Union,  if  the  adjustment  is  not  inconsistent  with  the  terms  of  this 
Agreement, provided that the Union has been given opportunity to be present at such adjustment.  
The Union may initiate its own grievances for protection and maintenance of this contract. 

The  Employer  agrees  to  furnish  to  the  Union  in  response  to  reasonable  requests  available 
information  concerning  the  financial  resources  of  the  University,  and  such  other  available 
information as will assist the Union in developing intelligent, accurate, informed and constructive 
programs on behalf of the Employees, together with information which may be necessary for the 
Union to process any grievance or complaint. 

The Employer recognizes the responsibilities imposed on the Union and will grant permission and 
a  reasonable  amount  of  time  to  he  authorized  representatives  of  the  Union  to  meet  with 
representatives  of  the  University  for  the  purpose  of  bargaining,  or  to  investigate  and  present 
grievances as provided in the Grievance Procedure.  The Union Representative shall give his/her 
Administrative Unit Head as much advance notice as possible of date, time, and purpose of such 
needed  released  time.    The  privilege  of  authorized  Union  personnel  leaving  their  work  during 
working hours without  loss of time or pay is subject to the understanding that the time will be 
devoted to the handling of such business. 

-5- 

 
In addition to the time off to meet with representatives of the University as specified above, the 
Union President will be given a total of five (5) hours off per week with pay to transact affairs of 
the Union, and the Financial Secretary of the Local Union will be given a total of four (4) hours off 
per  calendar  month  with  pay  to  transact  affairs  of  the  Union.  In  addition,  up  to  twelve  (12) 
additional members of the Union will be granted two (2) hours off per month with pay to attend 
the monthly board meetings.  The Union will provide a current list of Employees eligible to attend 
the monthly board meetings. 

Any alleged abuse by either party with respect to the amount of time or the number of authorized 
representatives of the Union involved will be a subject for a Special Conference of representatives 
of the Employer and the Union. 

The  Union  shall  have  a  representative  on  the  Fringe  Benefits Study Committee which concerns 
itself with such matters as insurance, parking, retirement, policies and procedures, and on other 
committees  mutually  agreed  upon.    It  is  understood  that  such  committee  cannot  bind  the 
University or the Union to any agreement arrived at by such committees. 

There shall be no additional payments of any kind to any Employee for time devoted to grievance 
handling after working hours unless such a grievance meeting is requested by the University.

F. 

 
B. 

 
C. 

 
D. 

The University agrees to notify all new Employees in classifications covered by this Agreement 
that the Union is the sole bargaining representative for their respective classifications. 

Except  as  provided  in  C.,  below,  Employees  covered  by  this  Agreement  shall  be  required  as  a 
condition of continued employment to become members in the Union or to pay service fees equal 
to the membership dues in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union for the 
duration of this Agreement and any extensions thereof. 

Present Employees of the bargaining unit who were employed by the University prior to July 1, 
1965,  and  who  are  not  now  members  of  the  Union  shall  not  be  required  as  a  condition  of 
continued employment to become members of the Union or pay a service fee equal to membership 
dues.  Employees hired, rehired, reinstated or transferred into the Bargaining Unit after the effective 
date  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  required,  as  a  condition  of  continued  employment,  to  become 
members of the Union, or to pay a service fee equal to membership dues, on or before the thirtieth 
(30th) day following the beginning of their employment in the unit. 

The University shall be notified in writing by the Union of any Employee in the Bargaining Unit 
who is thirty (30) days in arrears in payment of membership dues, or service fees.  Employees who 
fail to comply with this requirement shall be released by the University within thirty (30) days of 
such notice. 

-6- 

The Union shall indemnify and save the University harmless from any and all claims, demands, 
suits, or any other action arising from the above terms in this Article. 

Any dispute that arises regarding membership, non-membership and payment or non-payment of 
dues  or  fees,  shall  be  initiated  in  accordance  with  the  Pre-arbitration  step  of  the  Grievance 
Procedure.

Check-Off:  During the life of the Agreement or any extension thereof, and in accordance with the 
terms of the form of Authorization for Payroll Deduction for Union Service Fee, the University 
agrees  to  deduct  Union  membership  dues  and  service  fees  levied  in  accordance  with  the 
Constitution  and  By-Laws of the Union from the pay of each Employee who has executed the 
standard  form  of  the  University,  "Authorization  for  Payroll  Deduction  for  Union  Service Fee" 
(Form 10-627) or who executes the form mutually acceptable to the University and the Union. 

The University shall not be responsible for checking-off or collecting dues or service fees during 
periods of leaves of absence for which the Employee receives no pay from the University. 

The University will furnish the Union no later than the tenth (10th) of the month a listing of all dues 
and  service  fees  deducted  for  the  previous  month  for  all  Employees,  including  additions  and 
deletions since the last listing with an explanation of changes. A check payable to the Union shall 
accompany the listing.   

The University shall not be liable to the Union by reason of the requirements of this section for the 
remittance or payment of any sum other than that constituting actual deductions made from wages 
earned by Employees. 

The Union shall indemnify and hold the University harmless from any liability which might arise 
because of the improper deduction of money from an Employee's pay made in accordance with 
this Article.  It shall be the responsibility of the Employee to obtain appropriate refund from the 
Union. 

 
 
ARTICLE (5)  MAINTENANCE OF POLICIES 
 
A. 

Except  as  modified  by  this  Agreement,  general  personnel  policies  approved  by  the  Board  of 
Governors for University-wide application including Professional and Administrative Staff prior to 
the date of this Agreement shall remain in effect for Professional and Administrative personnel. 

In  the  event  changes  and/or  improvements  are  incorporated  in  such  policies,  they  shall 
automatically  be  extended  to  Professional  and  Administrative  personnel  except  as  otherwise 
modified by this Agreement. 

-7- 

In keeping with the policy of the University to maintain as near uniformly as practicable in fringe 
benefit programs, it is understood that improvements such as holiday, insurance, retirement and 
disability programs approved for all other collective bargaining groups which are eligible to receive 
such benefits will be extended at the same time to Professional and Administrative personnel. 

 
 
ARTICLE (6) MANAGEMENT RIGHTS 
 
All  management  rights  and  functions,  except  those  which  are  clearly  and  expressly  abridged  by  this 
Agreement, shall remain vested exclusively in the University.  It is expressly recognized, merely by way of 
illustration and not by way of limitation, that such rights and functions include, but are not limited to: 
 
A. 

Full and exclusive control of the management of the University, the supervision of all operations, 
the  methods,  processes,  means,  time,  place  and  personnel  by  which  any  and  all  work  will  be 
performed, the control of property and the composition, assignment, direction and determination 
of the size and type of its working forces. 

The right to determine the work to be done by Employees covered by this Agreement. 

The right to change or introduce new operations, methods, processes, means or facilities, and the 
right to determine whether and to what extent work should be performed by Employees. 

The right to establish the qualifications of Employees, and to suspend, discipline and discharge 
Employees for sufficient and reasonable cause and otherwise to maintain an orderly, effective and 
efficient operation. 

 
Nothing in this Article shall preclude or prohibit the Union or any Employee in the Union from exercising 
the rights contained in the Agreement. 
 
 
ARTICLE (7)  NON-DISCRIMINATION 
 
A. 

Fundamental to the American concept of democracy is the tradition that all persons are created 
equal  and  that  all  individuals  shall  be  judged  on  their  own  merits.    The  University  and  the 
Professional and Administrative Union join in this belief and commitment to an affirmative action 
policy that applicants will be hired and Employees will be treated without discrimination on the 
basis of race, creed, color or national origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, handicap or age. 
 Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following:  employment, upgrading, demotion 
or  transfer,  recruitment  or  recruitment  advertising,  layoff  or  termination,  rates  of  pay  or  other 
forms of compensation.

The  University  and  the  Professional  and  Administrative  Union  confirm  its  commitment  to  the 
reasonable accommodation of its members pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act. The 
University shall have the right to fill positions, without limitation by the seniority, transfer and/or 
promotional provisions contained in this Agreement, in order to satisfy its duty to accommodate.

E. 

To provide equal treatment with regard to sexual preference, the University Administration and the 
Union  recognize  the  status  of  domestic  partners.    A  domestic  partnership  is  defined  as  two 
individuals of the same gender who live together in a long-term relationship of indefinite duration, 
with  an  exclusive  mutual  commitment  in  which  the  partners  agree  to  be  jointly  responsible  for 
each other’s common welfare and share financial obligations.  The partners may not be related by 
blood  to  a  degree  of  closeness  which  would  prohibit  legal  marriage  in  the  state  in  which  they 
legally reside. 

To  the  extent  allowed  by  the  University’s  insurance/benefit  carriers  and  subject  to  such 
certification requirements as it may develop, the University’s equal treatment of domestic partners 
shall apply to insurance/benefit programs. 

Employees who believe that they have been discriminated against for the above listed reasons may 
choose to pursue their claim through the University's internal discrimination complaint procedure, 
administered by the Department of Equal Opportunity, or through the grievance procedure of this 
Agreement. 

The initial choice of one of these two internal procedures binds the Employee and the Union as to 
the discrimination aspect of any claim and prohibits the processing of that same discrimination 
claim through any other internal procedure. 

 
 
ARTICLE (8)  GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 
 
A. 

 

Any grievance or dispute which may arise between the parties involving the application, meaning, 
or interpretation of this Agreement shall be settled in conformity with the following established 
Grievance Procedures: 
 
A  grievance  not  processed  to  the  next  progressive  step  of  the  Grievance  Procedure  within  the 
specified time limits, shall be considered settled pursuant to such last step answer or withdrawn 
without  prejudice  (W.W.P.).    Such  action  shall  not  prejudice  the  Union  on  any  future  similar 
grievances.  A grievance withdrawn in accordance with this paragraph may be reinstated by the 
International Union at the Third Step of the grievance procedure.  Financial liability, if any, shall 
date only from the date of such reinstatement. 

STEP  1.    Any  Employee  having  a  grievance,  or  one  designated  member  of  a  group  having  a 
grievance, after first having notified the immediate supervisor of his/her grievance, may at his/her 
option discuss the matter directly with his/her supervisor or call his/her Union Representative for 
the purpose of attempting to adjust the grievance with the supervisor. 
 
STEP 2.  If the matter is unresolved, or the aggrieved is not satisfied with the results of Step 1, 
within five (5) working days following Step 1 the Union Representative shall put the grievance in 
writing on the mutually agreed to form (see Appendix) provided by the Employer and submit it to 
the  Administrative  Head  of  the  Unit  involved  or  his/her  designee.  The grievance shall state the 
nature of the grievance, the provision(s) alleged to have been violated, the adjustment sought, and 
the name(s) of the Employee(s) grieved. 

-9- 

 
 

 

 
B. 
 

 
C. 
 

 

The Administrative Head or his/her designee shall hold a meeting with the Union Representative 
and  the  grievant  within  five  (5)  working  days  of  receipt  of  the  written  grievance.    A  written 
disposition of the hearing shall be submitted to the Union Representative within five (5) working 
days of the hearing.  Any grievance not appealed in writing from an answer at Step 2 to Step 3 of  
the Grievance Procedure within five (5) working days after such answer, shall be considered settled 
on the basis of the last answer and not subject to further review.  No matter shall be subject to the 
grievance procedure unless it is presented in writing by the Union within twenty (20) working days 
following its occurrence, or within twenty (20) working days of the date it is reasonable to assume 
that the Employee became aware of it. 

STEP 3.  If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, it shall be presented by the Union to the Human 
Resources Division or its designee within five (5) working days after the answer given at Step 2.  A 
meeting shall be called within five (5) working days of receipt of the appeal.  Representatives of the 
University, not to exceed three (3) in number, will meet with representatives of the Union, not to 
exceed three (3) in number.  Additional persons may be present by mutual agreement.  A written 
disposition of the hearing shall be submitted to the Union Representative within five (5) working 
days of the hearing.  Any grievance not appealed from Step 3 within five (5) working days of such 
answer shall be considered settled on the basis of the last answer and not subject to further review. 

Pre-arbitration 

If  the  grievance  has  not  been  resolved  in  the  foregoing  steps  and  the  Union  desires  to  carry  it 
further,  the  matter  may  thereupon  be  referred  to  a  Pre-arbitration  Hearing  by  appealing  the 
grievance within five (5) working days of the answer given at Step 3.  The Pre-arbitration Hearing 
shall  be  held  within  ten  (10)  working  days  after  the  appeal  or  as  mutually  agreed.    The  Pre-
arbitration Committee shall consist of at least two (2) representatives selected by the Employer and 
at  least  two  (2)  representatives  selected  by  the  Union.  Additional  persons  may  be  present  by 
mutual agreement.  In the event the Pre-arbitration Committee above described is unable to arrive 
at  a  mutually  acceptable  solution  to  the  grievance,  then  the  Employer's  and  the  Union's 
representatives  on  the  Pre-arbitration  Committee  shall  jointly  submit  the  dispute  to  arbitration 
under  the  Voluntary  Labor  Arbitration  Rules,  then  obtaining,  of  the  American  Arbitration 
Association.  If the Employer or Union representatives refuse to join in such submission, either 
may demand arbitration, thus unilaterally invoking the process.  The arbitration process shall not 
be invoked unless the submission or demand is received by the American Arbitration Association 
within fifteen (15) working days after the Pre-arbitration meeting. 

Arbitration  

Any  unresolved  grievance  which  relates  to  the  interpretation,  application,  or  enforcement  of  a 
provision of this Agreement, or any written supplementary Agreement, and which has been fully 
processed  to  the  last  step  of  the  Grievance  Procedure,  may  be  submitted  to  arbitration  in  strict 
accordance with the following: 

 
 
1. 

The  American  Arbitration  Association  shall  be  requested  by  either  or  both  parties  to 

-10- 

 
 

 

 

 

 

2. 

 

3. 

4.

6. 

 
7. 

provide  a  panel  of  five (5) arbitrators.  Both the Employer and the Union shall have the 
right  to  strike  two  (2)  names  from  the  panel.    The  University  and  the  Union  shall  on 
alternate grievances strike the first name.  On the first grievance submitted to arbitration 
under this Contract the Union will strike the first name and the process will be reversed for 
subsequent grievances. 

Should either the University or the Union indicate that a particular grievance or dispute is of 
such a nature as to require expeditious determination, said party may waive the Arbitration 
procedure  as  set  forth  above  and  request  that  the  grievance  or  dispute  be  submitted  to 
Expedited Arbitration. 

Under  this  process  the  parties  shall  mutually  agree  to  select  an  Arbitrator  on  an  ad-hoc 
basis within seven (7) working days from the date that the request for Arbitration is made.  
Failure to mutually select an arbitrator within the above stated time period will require the 
parties to (within three (3) days thereafter) alternately strike arbitrators from the following 
panel: 

 

a. William Daniel 
b. Benjamin Kerner 
c. Daniel Kruger 

d. Jack Stieber 
e. Alan Walt 

The jurisdictional authority of the arbitrator is defined and limited to the determination of 
any grievance which involves a controversy concerning compliance with any provision of 
this  Agreement  and  is  submitted  to  him/her  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  this 
Agreement.  The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, or subtract from, or modify, any 
of the terms of the Agreement. 

The award of the arbitrator shall be based exclusively on evidence at the arbitration hearing. 

There  shall  be  no  appeal  from  an  arbitrator's  decision.  It  shall  be  final,  exclusive  and 
binding to the Union, on all the Bargaining Unit Employees, and on the University. The 
Union  will  discourage  any  attempt  by  any  Bargaining  Unit  Employee,  and  will  not 
cooperate with any Bargaining Unit Employee, in any appeal to any court or labor board 
from a decision of the arbitrator. 

The University, in no event, shall be required to pay back wages for more than thirty (30) 
working days prior to the date a written grievance is filed.  In the case of a pay shortage of 
which  the  Employee  could  not  have  been  aware  before  receiving  his/her  pay,  any 
adjustment shall be retroactive to the beginning of the pay period covered by such pay, if 
the Employee files his/her grievance within thirty (30) working days after receipt of such 
pay.  All claims for back wages shall be limited to the amount of wages that the Employee 
otherwise  would  have  earned,  less  any  unemployment  compensation,  or  wages  for 
personal  services  that  he/she  may  have  received  from  any  source  during  the  period  in 
question. 

The decision of the arbitrator in any case shall not require a retroactive wage adjustment in 

-11- 

 

 

 
D. 
 

 

 
E. 

 
F. 

any other case except in the case of representative cases when there is mutual agreement. 

8. 

 
9. 

The arbitrator shall be requested to issue his/her decision within thirty (30) days after the 
conclusion of testimony, argument, and submission of briefs. 

Expenses  of  the  arbitrator's  services  and  the  proceedings  shall  be  borne  equally  by  the 
Employer and the Union.  However, each party shall be responsible for compensating its 
own  representatives  and  witnesses,  except  that  two  (2)  Union  representatives  who  are 
Employees of the University will be provided time off with pay from their regular work day 
to  attend  the  arbitration  proceedings.  If  either  party  desires  a  verbatim  record  of  the 
proceedings, it may cause such a record to be made providing it pays for the record. 

Departmental/Unit-Wide Grievances 

1. 

2. 

Grievances involving a complete department, division or unit may be initiated at Step 2. 

In  the  event  that  the  Union  has  a  grievance,  it  shall  begin  at  Step  3  of  the  Grievance 
Procedure.  Such a grievance shall be submitted by the Union President, his/her designated 
representative, on behalf of the Union.  A Union grievance is defined as a disagreement 
arising under and during the term of this Agreement between the University and the Union 
concerning  the  interpretation  and  application  of  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  on  a 
question which is not an Employee grievance nor an Employee group grievance.  In the 
event of dispute on the application of this paragraph, the parties will discuss the dispute and 
by  mutual  agreement,  initiate  the  grievance  at  the  appropriate  step  of  the  grievance 
procedure. 

A grievance not answered by the University within the specified time limit may be referred by the 
Union to the next step of the grievance procedure. 

Nothing  in  this  Agreement  shall  limit  the  right  of  the  Employer  to  temporarily  fill  any  position 
pending the resolution of a grievance or to exercise any other right of management. 

By mutual agreement, extension of time limits may be granted. 

 
G. 
 
 
ARTICLE (9)  NO STRIKES/NO LOCK OUTS 
 
The  Union  recognizes  that  during  the  life  of  this  Agreement,  neither  it  nor  its  officers,  representatives, 
committee persons, and stewards will for any reason, directly or indirectly, call, sanction, or engage in any 
strike,  walkout,  slow-down,  sit-down,  stay-away,  limitation  of  production,  boycott  of  a  primary  or 
secondary nature, picketing or any other form of interference with the peaceful operation of the business 
of the University. 
 
 
 
 

 

 
-12-

In the event that Employees represented by the Professional and Administrative Union engage in any of 
the  above  activities,  the  President  of  the  Union  or  a  representative  thereof  will,  upon  request  from  the 
Human  Resources  Division,  immediately  notify  them  of  the  inappropriate  nature  of  their  activity  and 
direct them to return to their jobs.  The University agrees that during the term of this Agreement, it will not 
lock out any of the Employees covered by this Agreement.

Department or its designee for appropriate action.  A written report on the disposition of 
the recommendations will be sent to the committee within thirty (30) days. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 
ARTICLE (11)  PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES 
 
A. 

An Employee is a "probationary Employee" for the first six (6) months of employment.  This time 
period may be extended on a month-to-month basis for periods not to exceed an additional six (6) 
months by agreement with the Union.  Periods of absence from work shall not be counted toward 
completion of the probationary period. 

 
-13-

There  shall  be  no  continuing  service  rights  for  lay-off,  recall,  discipline,  or  discharge  for 
"probationary employees," and no such matters will be subject to the Grievance Procedure.  Upon 
completion of the probationary period the Employee will acquire continuing service rights from 
his/her date of hire. 

The  Union  shall  represent  probationary  Employees  for  the  purposes  of  collective  bargaining  in 
respect  to  rates  of  pay,  wages,  hours,  and  other  conditions  of  employment.    The  probationary 
Employee shall have the same rights as other Employees, except as modified in this Article.

of any provisions of this Contract. 

While "tenure status" will not be afforded by our Contract to other persons in the unit, Betty Ray 
will continue to be given  all the benefits of tenure status during the course of their employment 
with the University. 

Continuing Service Status 

For members of the Union who do not have continuing tenure, the Articles of this Contract on 
continuing service are provided for job security purposes in lieu of tenure. 

1.

Verbal Notification 

The  supervisor  shall  hold  a  private  conference  with  the  Employee  for  the  purpose  of 
discussing  job  performance  deficiencies  or  unacceptable  professional  standards  and 
principles.  Coaching, which requires specific suggestions on performance improvement, is 
strongly  encouraged  prior  to  formal  written  notification  under  Section  2.    Additional 
conferences  may  be  held  if  the  supervisor  or  Employee  feel  such  will  ensure  mutual 
understanding and desired correction. 
 
Official Written Notification 

If the Employee's job performance or professional standards and principles do not 
improve to an acceptable degree within a reasonable period following conference(s), 
the Employee shall be given, in a meeting with the supervisor, a written notice of 
his/her  unacceptable  and  uncorrected  deficiencies.    The  written  notification  shall 
include  the  supervisor's  specific  suggestions  and  a  timetable  for  expected 
corrections, including at least one follow-up meeting.  The written notice shall be 
signed by both the supervisor and the Employee.  The Employee's signature shall 
indicate  only  that  the  Employee  has  read  the  notice  but  does  not  represent 
concurrence  or  non-concurrence with the content  of such notice.  The Employee 
may, at his/her option, notify the Union of such written notification.  The signed 
letter of notification will be handled as described in (b) and (c) which follow. 
 
Additional  conferences  may  be  held  if  the  supervisor  or  Employee  feel  such  will 
ensure mutual understanding and desired correction. 

The  Employee  may  request  representation  by  the  Union  at  the  progressive 
correction meeting with the supervisor for the purpose of ensuring completeness of 
understanding of the unresolved problem and corrective efforts made-to-date.  

If  the  matter  remains  unresolved  after  the  progressive  correction  meeting,  the 
Employee shall be afforded the opportunity to append his/her written position with 
respect to the problem to the supervisor's letter of notification for joint submission 
to the Labor Relations Department and Personnel Records. 

Such official written notification, together with the Employee's optional response to 
same,  shall  be  removed  from  the  file  after  the  follow-up  meeting,  if  in  the 
supervisor's judgement the performance is no longer deficient, or no later than two 
(2)  years  of  non-repetitive  job  deficiency  necessitating  such  an  official  written 
notification.  Supervisors are encouraged to remove disciplinary action before the 
three years, if the problem performance has been adequately resolved.

Suspension/Dismissal Proceedings 

Only  after  progressive  corrective  procedures  (Section  A,  above)  have  been  followed  may

requested by the subject Employee. 
 
Notify  the  Employee  and  the  Union  of  the  suspension  or  dismissal  and  provide  written 
reason(s). 

If an Employee is not suspended/dismissed, all written materials relative to the case must 
be removed immediately from all personnel files on the Employee. 

If suspension/dismissal is to be invoked, the Employee and Union must be notified of the 
effective date of suspension/dismissal. 

If suspension is invoked, all written materials relative to the case must be removed from all 
personnel files on the Employee after two (2) years from date of suspension provided no 
further action relative to the matter is pending. 

Immediate Suspension/Discharge 

1. 

For  any  act(s)  that  represent  a  threat  to  life,  person,  or  property,  or  for  just  cause,  an 
Employee may be immediately suspended/discharged by the Labor Relations Department 
or its designate.  In such cases the Labor Relations Department or its designate will take the 
following steps: 

a) 

 
b) 

c) 

Notify  the  Employee  and  the  Union  of  the  suspension/discharge  as  soon  as 
possible. 

In  instances  of  suspension  hold  a  meeting  with  the  principals  in  attendance, 
together with Union representatives if requested by the subject Employee, within 
two (2) working days of the suspension action or such other agreed upon date. 

In instances of discharge hold a meeting, if requested by the Employee, within two 
(2) working days of the discharge action.  The Employee will exercise his/her option 
with respect to Union representation. 

2. 

If the Employee is not suspended/dismissed, all written materials relative to the case will be 
removed from all personnel files of the Employee.

All dismissal and suspension actions must be appealed in writing and signed by the Employee at 
Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure within five (5) working days after written notice of decision. 

 
 
ARTICLE (14)  REDUCTION OF WORK FORCE AND RECALL 
 
A. 
 

Reduction of Work Force and Recall 

 

 
 
 
D. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grievance Proceedings for Suspension/Dismissal 

In the event it should become necessary to reduce the number of Employees in the bargaining unit, 
or to formally discontinue a University position to which a P&A/UAW member is assigned, the 
University agrees to provide written notice to the Employee and the Union at least thirty (30) days 
prior to the actual reduction, except in instances of unusual or extenuating circumstances.  It is 
understood, however, that an Employee who receives such notice must respond to the University 
within  five  (5)  days  indicating  whether  the  Employee  will  accept  appropriate  employment  if 
available under the work force reduction procedure.  If the Employee's acceptance of such work 
results in the layoff of another Employee, that Employee shall receive as much notice of layoff as 
is possible. 

In  the  event  of  layoff,  the  University  shall  meet  with  the  Union,  on  request,  prior  to  the 
contemplated reduction to review how the reduction will be accomplished. 

In an effort to provide that Employees with the least seniority are the first to be subject to any 
necessary work force reduction, the following order of layoff will be implemented: 

1. 

In  order  for  any  transfer  or  recall  to  take  place  per  the  following  provisions,  the  subject 
Employee must have the qualifications and the ability to perform the duties of the available 
position. 

An Employee placed into a position under the provisions of this Article may be subject to 
the ninety (90) day job qualifying period.  If an Employee is subject to such a qualifying 
period,  both  the  Employee  and  the  Union  shall  be  notified  as  to  the  Employee's 
performance. 

There shall be a minimum of two (2) progress reports within the ninety (90) day period.  
The first report must be done midway through the period and the second report must be 
done prior to the expiration of the ninety (90) day qualifying period. 
 
Any Employee subject to the job qualifying period and disqualified within the ninety (90) 
day period shall continue to exercise seniority under the provisions of this Article.

Employees who have not completed the probationary period will be the first laid off within 
the  affected  classification  in  the  department  or  division  where  reductions  are  deemed 
necessary.    Any  "temporary"  position  in  a  classification  represented  by  the  Union  for 
possible elimination in lieu of the contemplated reduction of any regular position. 

The subject Employee, with the least classification seniority in the classification affected 
within a department or division shall be the first to be laid off provided the Employee(s) 
remaining have the ability to perform the work available. 

The subject Employee shall be transferred to a vacancy in his/her classification in his/her 
division or department, if such exists. 

If such does not exist, the subject Employee shall be transferred to a vacancy in his/her 
classification in the University, if such exists. 

If no vacancies exist within the subject Employee's classification, he/she shall displace the 
lowest classification seniority person in his/her classification in the University, if he/she has 
higher seniority in the classification than the displaced Employee. 

If 4, 5, and 6 above do not provide employment, the subject Employee shall be transferred 
to a vacancy in the next lower level of his/her classification sequence in the department or 
division, if such exists.   

"Classification sequence" shall be defined as classifications with identical titles, but varying 
degrees of responsibility, (e.g., Administrative Assistant I, Administrative Assistant II, etc.). 

If such does not exist, the subject Employee shall be transferred to a vacancy in the next 
lower level of his/her classification sequence in the University, if such exists. 

If  no  vacancies  exist  within the next lower level of the subject Employee's classification 
sequence, he/she shall displace the lowest classification seniority person in the next lower 
level in his/her classification sequence in the University, if he/she has higher bargaining unit 
seniority than the displaced Employee. 

Any  Employee  who  refuses  employment  offered  by  the  University  in  the  same  or  next 
lower level of his/her classification sequence in accordance with the above provisions shall 
be considered a voluntary termination. 

If 8 or 9 above does not provide employment, the subject Employee shall displace the least 
senior Employee in the job groupings provided he/she has the qualifications and ability to 
perform  the  work.    The  position  must  be  at  a  salary  range  equal  to  or  lower  than  the 
Employee's former position (see Appendix D). 

The  "least  senior"  Employee  is  defined  as  the  Employee  with  the  least  seniority  in  the 
bargaining unit.

Recall 

 

An Employee subject to layoff, to whom the University does not offer employment in  
accordance with the above provisions, may apply for any job vacancy in the bargaining 
unit for which he/she believes himself/herself to be qualified; and he/she will be transferred 
by the University to the position if he/she possesses the qualifications and the ability to 
perform the duties of the available position and if such a transfer does not interfere with the 
seniority  rights  of  any  other  bargaining  unit  Employee  under  the  provisions  of  this 
Agreement. 

A displaced Employee with higher bargaining unit seniority may displace a lower seniority 
Employee in the lowest level of a classification sequence who is at the same salary range or 
lower in the bargaining unit. The Employee must have the qualifications and present ability 
to perform the duties of the position. 

Any Employee who cannot be placed under the provisions of 11, 12 and 13 above shall be 
given preferential consideration for suitable vacancies within the University for which they 
are qualified and which they have the ability to perform prior to the University hiring new 
personnel, provided such consideration does not conflict with any provision of any other 
collective bargaining agreement entered into by the University. 

Any Employee who does not exercise his/her seniority in filling a position as provided for 
in  11,  12,  13  and  14  above,  shall  be  placed  on  layoff  and  shall  be  subject  to  recall  in 
accordance with the recall provisions of this Article. 

In the event an Employee is, under the provisions of this Article, transferred or recalled to a 
position in the classification from which he/she was laid off, or to a position in another 
classification at the same salary grade, the Employee shall be paid at the same rate he/she 
was receiving prior to the layoff. 

"Same rate" shall be defined as the same salary rate plus any across-the-board increases 
provided to the salary grade if the Employee is recalled to the same grade or the same step 
or relative position within the merit range if the Employee is recalled to a lower grade. 
 
In the event the Employee is, under the provisions of this Article, transferred or recalled to 
a  position  in  a  classification  at  a  salary  grade  lower  than  that  of  his/her  previous 
classification, the Employee shall be paid at the salary level (step) closest to, but not higher 
than, his/her previous salary, and not higher than the maximum in the new classification. 

A transfer or layoff shall not result in a reduction of total University service or of bargaining 
unit seniority.

Recall  shall  be  in  inverse  order  of  layoff,  and  laid  off  Employees  shall  be  recalled  as 
specified  below  before  any  new  Employees  are  hired,  provided  they  have  the  ability  to 
perform the work available. 

Notice of recall shall be sent to the "laid off" Employee at his/her last address of record by 
registered or certified mail.  If the Employee fails to respond within five (5) days from the 
date of delivery of the notice of recall, or in the event no delivery is possible ten (10) days 
after mailing, and/or if he/she does not agree to report to work within ten (10) days from 
the date of response, he/she shall be terminated, unless reasonable cause, in writing, prior 
to the filling of the position, is given for not responding or not reporting.  Extension of the 
five (5) day period of response and the ten (10) day report-to-work period may be granted 
by the University for unusual circumstances or appropriate cause. 

The University shall maintain a list of laid off Employees according to classification and 
bargaining unit seniority.  Laid off Employees shall have recall rights for a period equal to 
their length of service up to three (3) years.  

Probationary Employees shall not be extended "recall" rights. 

Laid  off  Employees  will  return  to  work  with  the  same  continuing  service  status  and 
seniority they had at the time of the layoff. 

The  University  shall  recall  Employees  to  positions  in  their  previous  classification  or  to 
positions in the next lowest level of their classification sequence, provided they have the 
ability  to  perform  the  duties  of  the  available  position.    Such  work  shall  be  considered 
comparable  to  their  previous  positions,  and  a  refusal  of  such  an  employment  offer  shall 
terminate an Employee's seniority, recall and employment rights with the University.  The 
University  may  also  recall  Employees  to  other  comparable  bargaining  unit  positions  for 
which they are qualified, and a refusal of such an employment offer in the salary grade of 
their previous classification or the next lower salary grade shall terminate the Employee's 
seniority, recall, and employment rights with the University. 

Demotional Transfers 

1. 

2. 

 
3. 

The University shall maintain a listing of Employees who accept a demotional transfer in 
lieu of layoff. 

Employees  who  accept  demotional  transfers  in  lieu  of  layoff  shall  be  accorded  the 
opportunity to return to their former positions in the event said position is reestablished 
within  a  period  equal  to  their  length  of  service  up  to  three  (3)  years  from  the  date  of 
demotional transfer. 

"Preferential" consideration shall be accorded to the demotional transfer  Employee as a 
candidate  for  other  position  openings  in  his/her  former  Professional  and  Administrative 

 
-21-

Union classification for a period equal to his/her length of service up to three (3) years.  
Such preferential privilege shall not be accorded more than two (2) times within the stated 
time period. 

Superseniority 

For purposes of layoff and recall determination, officers and directors of the Union, not to exceed 
twelve  (12),  shall  be  considered  to  have  the  highest  classification  service  in  their  particular 
classifications.  The Union will furnish in writing to the University and keep current, a list of the 
officers and directors. 

Continuation of Insurance Upon Layoff 

1.  

2. 

A laid off Employee who had completed his/her probationary period shall be eligible to 
continue  currently  elected  group  medical,  group 
life,  and  accidental  death  or 
dismemberment  coverage  with  the  same  University  subsidy  as  extended  to  active 
Employees for one hundred and eighty (180) days beyond the end of the month in which 
the Employee was laid off.  In no case shall such coverage extend beyond the end of the 
month in which the laid off Employee is re-employed elsewhere. 

The laid off Employee shall request desired insurance coverage (in writing) within thirty-
one  (31)  days  after  the  end  of  the  month  in  which  he/she  is  laid  off.    He/she  shall be 
invoiced monthly for his/her share of premium. 

Subsidized Positions 

Effective 1/1/94, Employees who are hired into or who are promoted, or who transfer voluntarily 
into  a  position  which  is  subject  to  subsidy  conditioned  funding,  shall  be  ineligible  to  displace 
another Employee in a reduction in force or when the subsidy is discontinued. 

Employees  in  positions  which  are  subject  to  subsidy  conditioned  funding  shall  receive  written 
notice whenever the subsidy is discontinued. 

Employees  who  are  displaced from positions which are subject to subsidy conditioned funding 
shall  receive  preferential  consideration  for  a  period  not  to  exceed  one  year  when  applying  for 
vacant positions within the bargaining unit as provided above.  Preferential consideration shall be 
given only if there are no qualified bargaining unit members with layoff rights who have applied 
for  the  position.    The  Employee  shall  be  entitled  to  consideration  before  a  non-bargaining unit 
member is hired for the vacant position, but in no case shall a candidate be placed in a position 
where s/he lacks the qualifications and ability to perform the duties of the available position.

ARTICLE (15)  PROMOTIONS AND TRANSFERS 

 

 
-22-

 
In the best interests of the Union and the University, the University shall promote or transfer Employees 
from within under the following circumstances: 
 
Through  9/30/96,*  or  as  thereafter  extended  by  mutual  agreement,  University-trained  hiring  authorities 
may utilize more than one method of promotion as set forth below.  They may fill vacant positions on the 
basis  of  seniority  [most-senior-qualified]  (Method  1)  or  selecting-the-most-qualified (Method 2).  Only 
those hiring authorities that have completed the following training shall be eligible to use method 2:  a) 
effective  selection  interviewing,  b)  performance  appraisal,  and  c)  contract  administration.    Hiring 
authorities  that  have  not  yet  completed  all  three  modules  must  make  hiring  decisions  based  on  most-
senior-qualified, Method 1 only. 
 
METHOD 1 - SENIORITY-BASED HIRING 
 
A. 

Current University Employees who apply and possess the specific qualifications for a bargaining 
unit position shall be promoted or transferred before any non-Employees. 

In those cases where two or more bargaining unit personnel meet the specific qualifications for the 
open  position,  the  bargaining  unit  member  with  the  most  service  in  the  bargaining  unit  will  be 
promoted or transferred. 

The Employee promoted or transferred shall have a three (3) month provisional period.  At the end 
of the three (3) month period, the Employee will: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Be removed from provisional status; or 

Be returned to his/her former position if available; or 

Be placed in a position within his/her former  classification. 

 

 
B. 

 
C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the event that placement cannot be made pursuant to C.3. above, the Employer will attempt to 
place the Employee pursuant to Article (14), Reduction of Work Force and Recall, and shall begin 
with section A.6. of that Article. 

 
*After  9/30/96,  absent  extension,  or  invoking  of  Section  F  of  Method  2,  promotional  and  transfer 
decisions, shall be limited to Method 1. 
 

No reduction in salary below that of such Employee's former classification shall occur before the 
Employee is placed into a position pursuant to Article (14) or before thirty (30) days have expired, 
whichever is less.  The thirty (30) day period shall begin on the date the Employee receives notice 
of completion of the provisional status period.  An Employee not placed under these provisions 
shall be laid-off pursuant to Article (14). 
 
The decision to return an Employee to his/her former position or classification is not subject to the 
grievance and arbitration procedure. 

 
-23-

The provisional period may be extended on a month-to-month basis for periods not to exceed an 
additional three (3) months by agreement with the Union.  Periods of absence from work shall not 
be counted toward completion of the provisional period. 
 
In recognition of the mutual benefit accruing from the development of a broad based, diversified 
talent  pool  with  expertise  in  various  facets  of  the  operation  of  the  University,  it  is  agreed  that 
whenever an opening occurs in an existing or similar classification, an Employee presently holding 
such  classification  may  elect  to  execute  preferential  transfer  rights  once  in  any  three  (3)  year 
period, prior to implementing the promotional procedure.  

However, in no event shall a senior Employee be forced to accept or retain a given objectionable 
position  unless  such  position  is  the  result  of:    a)  position  elimination,  b)  major  technological 
change in the position, c) major structural departmental reorganization.  
 
In the event a position is eliminated and that same position is reinstated within three (3) years, the 
displaced  Employee  will  have  automatic  guaranteed  return  rights  to  the  reinstated  position 
providing that Employee has the ability to perform the work. 

An  Employee  who  is  not  promoted  or  transferred,  upon  written  request  shall  be  informed  in 
writing of the reasons for non-selection as soon as possible, but in no event later than fifteen (15) 
working  days  of  receipt  of  the  written  request.  A  copy  shall  be  furnished  to  the  Union  upon 
request.

METHOD 2 - MOST-QUALIFIED-BASED HIRING 
 
A. 

Promotions and transfers shall be based on job related qualifications and ability.  Where these are 
equal, an Employee with the most bargaining unit seniority shall be promoted or transferred.  In 
determining  qualifications  and  ability,  the  University  may  consider,  but  is  not  limited  to,  such 
factors as: 

1. 

 
2.   
 

3.   

4.   

Job  performance  on  current  and  previous  assignment(s).  (For  purposes  of  this  Article, 
performance  evaluations  on  record  as  well  as  those  conducted  pursuant  to  the  newly 
introduced performance appraisal form, may be used.  Those P&A employees rated at least 
fully  satisfactory  (FS)  shall  have  preference  over  non-P&A  candidates  when  all  other 
selection  requirements  are  equal  among  candidates.  In such instances, P&A bargaining 
unit seniority shall serve as the tie breaker.  Among P&A candidates, those rated higher are 
presumed more qualified, where all other requirements are equal.) 

Job knowledge  
(Including University certification in competencies required of the position, as determined 
and assessed by the University.)

Ability to perform the job with or without accommodation  

Grievances based on the hiring authority's selection decision must be filed at the third step of the 
grievance  procedure  and  not  later  than  5  working  days  after  communication  of  the  selection 
decision.    The  step  4  meeting  shall  be  held  within  30  calendar  days  of  the  selection  decision 
notification, unless extended by mutual agreement. Either party may demand expedited arbitration 
(from a new panel selected solely for this purpose) not later than 10 calendar days after the step 4 
meeting.  The arbitration panel consists of Alan Walt, William Daniel, Benjamin Kerner, Daniel 
Kruger, and Jack Stieber. 

In  recognition  of  the  need  to  more  clearly  define  the  duties,  responsibilities  and  minimum 
qualifications  for  positions,  a 
joint  committee  comprised  of  Union  and  Management 
representatives will meet to study and address the concept of standardized postings. 

The Employee promoted or transferred shall have a three (3) month provisional period.  At the end 
of the three (3) month period, the Employee will: 

1.   

2.   
 
3.   

Be removed from provisional status; or 

Be returned to his/her former position if available; or 

Be placed in a position within his/her former classification. 

In the event that placement cannot be made pursuant to D.3. above, the Employer will attempt to 
place the Employee pursuant to Article (14), Reduction of Work Force and Recall, and shall begin 
with Section A.6. of that Article.  
 
No reduction in salary below that of such Employee's former classification shall occur before the 
Employee is placed into a position pursuant to Article (14) or before thirty (30) days have expired, 
whichever is less.  The thirty (30) day period shall begin on the date the Employee receives notice 
of completion of the provisional status period.  An Employee not placed under these provisions 
shall be laid-off pursuant to Article (14). 

The decision to return an Employee to his/her former position or classification is not subject to the 
grievance and arbitration procedure.  
 
The provisional period may be extended on a month-to-month basis for periods not to exceed an 
additional three (3) months by mutual agreement with the Union.  Periods of absence from work 

 
-25-

 

 
E. 

shall not be counted toward completion of the provisional period. 

A  bargaining  unit  Employee  who  is  not  promoted  or  transferred  and  is  more  senior  than  the 
selected  candidate,  shall  be  informed  in  writing  of  the  reasons  for  non-selection  as  soon  as 
possible, but in no event later than fifteen (15) working days after the employment offer is made to 
the successful candidate.  A copy shall be furnished to the Union upon request. 
 
The less senior candidate(s) shall be informed of the reasons(s) upon written request within the 
same time frame. 

 

 
-26-

In all hiring, promotions or transfers, the University shall inform the Union in writing within ten 
(10)  working  days  of  the  decision  to  hire,  promote,  or  transfer  using  this  method.  All 
communications shall include the specific deciding factors for utilization of Method 2 (i.e., why the 
department did not hire the P&A member(s) and why the external or less senior person was hired.) 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The  Union  shall  establish  a  Method  2  Monitoring  Committee,  which  shall  assist  in 
investigating concerns about operation of this method. 

Unresolved  concerns  of  the  Monitoring  Committee  shall  be  addressed  to  the  Union 
Executive Committee or its Designees. 

The  Executive  Committee  or  its  designees  shall  address  concerns  through  special 
conference(s) with University Designees and the Labor Relations Department.

ARTICLE (16)  PROMOTIONS AND TRANSFERS 
 
A. 

An Employee who is transferred or promoted from one bargaining unit whose contract contains 
this  provision,  to  another  bargaining  unit  whose  contract  also  contains  this  provision  shall  be 
placed on provisional status for six (6) months.  During the six (6) months provisional period, the 
Employee if unable to perform the work may be returned by the Employer to such Employee's 
previous position, if available, or to such Employee's previous classification, if a suitable vacancy 
exists.  If the Employee's previous position is not available, and if there is no suitable vacancy in 
the  previous  classification,  the  Employee  shall  have  the  opportunity  to  exercise  the  lay  off 
provision in the Contract. 

Grievance  and  arbitration  procedures  are  available  to  provisional  Employees;  however,  a 
provisional  Employee's  removal  from  the  new  classification  during  the  provisional  period  for 
inability  to  perform  the  work  and  immediate  or  pending  return  to  the  previous  position  or 
classification under Section A. of this Article shall not be subject to grievance or arbitration.  An 
Employee who is discharged for just cause during the provisional period may grieve the discharge. 

A transfer or promotion between bargaining units whose contracts contain this provision shall not 
interrupt University service. 

A provisional Employee who is returned or elects to return within one (1) year to such Employee's 
previous classification shall return with the same status as such Employee had when the transfer 
was initiated.  The Employee shall be returned to the same step or relative position on the salary 
schedule as before the promotion or transfer.  Such Employee shall be credited with the service 
(seniority) the Employee accumulated in the position to which she/he was transferred or promoted. 

Employees transferred or promoted shall receive the benefits of the new position while they are in 
that  position.    If  an  Employee  who  has  earned  vacation  is  transferred  or  promoted  to  a 
classification which does not have vacation, the Employee shall either use the vacation prior to the 
transfer or promotion or shall be paid for any accrued vacation. 

Employees who request a transfer which results in a voluntary downgrade will be placed in the 

-27-
 

 

 
G. 

same step or relative position in the new salary grade as they held in the higher grade.  

Competencies Study Committee  
The University  and  P&A  are  mindful  of  the  benefit  of  defining  the  competencies  required  for 
career advancement and having a well-trained workforce.   The parties also recognize the benefit of 
documenting the mastery of those competencies by candidates for P&A positions.  Therefore, a 
3x3 study group will be convened to examine these issues, consisting of P&A and management 
employees.  The study group will formulate recommendations for adoption or modification by the 
Executive  Vice-President.    The  study  group’s  initial  focus  will  be  the  administrative  assistant 
classification series.  Study of other positions shall be by mutual agreement. 

 
ARTICLE (17)  OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT 
 
A  moderate  amount  of  outside  employment  is  permissible,  provided  that  it  does  not  conflict  with 
University duties and does not adversely affect the quality of University service. 
 
If the University determines that an Employee's outside employment is affecting the performance of the 
Employee's work at the University, he/she will be so advised and expected to take steps to remedy the 
situation.  
 
 
ARTICLE (18)  PARTICIPATION IN PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
 
The  University  maintains  institutional  memberships  in  selected  state  and  national  organizations.  
Employees who are designated by the University as institutional representatives and are assigned by the 
University  for  attendance  at  sessions  of  those  organizations  shall  be  reimbursed  by  the  University  for 
expenses incident thereto, in accordance with the established policies for expense reimbursement. 
 
Whenever Employees are assigned to attend any professional meetings as official representatives of the 
University, expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with the established policies and procedures.  All 
such Employee participation must be approved in advance. 
 
These policies are in no way inconsistent with the Employee's option to participate as an individual and at 
his/her own expense in professional organizations that establish and maintain the Employee's status as a 
professional person.  Where attendance at functions of such professional organizations requires release 
time, it may be approved by the Administrative Head of the department, based on the merits of the request 
and where work schedules of the department permit.

ARTICLE (19)  FRACTIONAL-TIME 
 
The University, recognizing the professional character of Employees represented by the Professional and 
Administrative Union, may authorize transfer to fractional-time assignments when such assignments best 
serve  the  interests  of  the  Employee  and  the  University  and  can  be  arranged  with  the  approval  of  the 
administrative  head.    The  parties  recognize  that  there  are  practical  limits  to  the  number  of  such 
assignments, and such assignments should specify the duration and time of return to full-time work. 
 
A. 
 

Definition 

Fractional-time assignment shall mean any percentage of time worked between fifty (50) percent 
and one hundred (100) percent. 

Benefits 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Fractional-time Employees shall receive medical and health insurance, life insurance and 
dental  insurance,  and  appropriate  retirement  contribution,  in  the  same  manner  as  would 
apply to any Employee working full-time. 

Vacation  allowances  and  short-term  disability  benefits  shall  accrue  to  fractional-time 
Employees in proportion to the fraction of time worked. 

Fractional-time Employees are entitled to be paid for University observed holidays which 
fall on any of the Employee's scheduled work days on a fractional-time basis. 

Seniority 

Fractional time shall be regarded as equal to full time, save for appropriate evaluation of experience 
under Art. 15, or where specifically treated differently.

In the event a dispute arises concerning the appropriateness of material posted on bulletin boards, 
the President of the Union will be advised by the Personnel Office of the nature of the dispute and 
the notices or bulletins in question will not be removed from the bulletin boards until an immediate 
conference with the Union is held.  If a dispute still exists after said conference, the material will be 
removed and the Union shall have the right to file a grievance. 

 
 
ARTICLE (21)  POSITION POSTINGS/COMMUNICATIONS 
 
A. 

It is general University policy to fill  University position openings from within whenever there are 
qualified  applicants  available  within  the  University.    Members  of  the  Professional  and 
Administrative Union may apply for positions for which they believe they are qualified. 

The position posting represents an outline of the duties for that particular position and its purpose 
is not to represent the full scope of responsibilities or accountabilities for either that position or for 
that entire classification. 

Notices of position openings shall be widely distributed on campus for informational purposes and 
bulletin board placement.  Such notices shall remain posted for a minimum of ten (10) working 
days prior to application closing date. 

This Article shall not prevent the University from devising more expeditious, less paper intensive, 
or otherwise improved methods of communicating information about openings, and revising its 
posting procedures accordingly.  The Union shall be advised of improved methods prior to their 
implementation. 

New appointments to the University and assignments within the University shall be made with full 
effort to obtain the best qualified person for each position and, therefore, only after a thorough 
canvass of available personnel.  Blood or marital relationship to other Employees of the University 
shall  not  be  regarded  as  a  deterrent  to  appointment,  reassignment  or  continuance  in  present 
position, except that close relatives may not be employed where one is in a position of influence 
relative to the other. 

The University will continue to define close relatives to be: husband and wife, parent and child, 
including son-in-law and daughter-in-law, brothers and sisters, and to define a position of influence 
to exist where selection for employment, supervision of University duties, or judgment concerning 
fitness for promotion or discharge with cause requires the action of one person with respect to the 
other.

ARTICLE (23)  PERSONNEL FILES 
 
A. 

Each  Employee  shall  have  the  right  upon  written  request  to  examine  the  contents  of  their  own 
personnel  files  as  maintained  by  the  Division  of  Human  Resources  and  as  maintained  by  their 
Department or Division, the only exclusion being confidential pre-employment credentials of an 
evaluative nature.  These two files shall be considered the official University files.  The contents of 
any other unofficial files shall not be used as the basis upon which discipline or other personnel 
actions  may  be  taken.    The  Employee  shall  make  an  appointment  with  the  Division  of  Human 
Resources or the Department or Division Head to examine their personnel file. The Employee may 
be accompanied by a representative of the Union if the Employee so desires.  The Employee may 
designate, in writing, that they desire a representative of the Union to examine their file in their 
absence, and the representative shall be allowed to examine the file. 

No  official  report  nor  any  derogatory  statement  about  an  Employee  shall  be  filed  unless  the 
Employee is sent a dated copy.  The Employee has the right to submit a response to the report or 
statement, and such a response shall be attached to and filed with the report or statements in the 
Employee's file. 

Each  Employee  shall  have  the  right  to  place  in  his/her  personnel  file  material  which  attests  to 
his/her proficiency and experience. 

At  the  Employee's  request,  the  Employer  shall  reproduce  any  material  in  his/her  personnel  file 
except confidential pre-employment credentials of an evaluative nature, provided that a reasonable 
duplication fee is paid by the Employee.

A. 

The standard work day shall consist of eight and one-half (8½) hours including one (1) hour off for 
lunch without pay.  At the department’s discretion a work day may consist of eight (8) hours with 
one-half (½) hour for lunch.  

The normal work week shall consist of five (5) consecutive working days, Monday through Friday, 
for  a  total  of  thirty-seven  and  one-half  (37½)  hours  in  any  one  week,  followed  by  two  (2) 
consecutive  days  off.    When  necessity  demands  any  weekend  scheduling,  affected  Employees 
within a unit will be scheduled for such work on a rotational basis at time and one-half, provided 
they are qualified to perform the necessary services. 

In any department under a seven day operation, Employees within that department shall normally 
work five (5) consecutive days which may be other than Monday-Friday with a sixth or seventh 
day work assignment at time and one-half. 

Employees whose schedules are changed so that a five (5) consecutive day schedule is not possible 
will  make  up  the  lost  time  without  receiving  overtime  payment  for  the  sixth  or  seventh  day 
worked. 

In the event an Employee is not able to report for work at his/her regularly scheduled time, he/she 
should notify his/her department head prior to the scheduled starting time.

Where  variations  in  normal  Employee  work  schedules  are  necessary,  they  may  be  arranged  in 
advance  with  the  appropriate  administrative  head.    Administrative  heads  are  encouraged  to 
consider the concept of flexible scheduling. 

Changes  in  established  work  day  or  work  week  will  be  made  only  after  prior  notification  and 
consultation with representatives of the Union. 

Library  Assistants  assigned  a  Monday-Friday  work  week,  whose  schedule  includes  only  one 
afternoon/evening assignment, will be given an additional forty-five (45) minutes meal time on the 
day they work the afternoon/evening assignment. 

Library Assistants assigned to the circulation desk in the Purdy Library will be scheduled on a five 
(5) day work week, Monday through Friday.  Effective on/after August 1, 1985, Library Assistants 
hired, voluntarily transferred or promoted into assignments at the circulation desk in Purdy Library 
may be subject to seven day operation work schedules in accordance with Paragraph (C) above.

As of the first full pay period after 10/1/00, the following principles shall govern extra authorized 
hours worked by employees in group D (P&A employees not in group C).   
[SEE LETTER OF AGREEMENT #17 FOR INAPPLICABILITY] 
 
1. 

All group D employees shall be compensated, providing the Supervisor mutually agrees, 
additional  straight  time  for  work  after  37.5  hours  and  on  holidays,  notwithstanding  the 
provisions  of  Article  25a.  Where  mutual  agreement  with  the  supervisor  is  not  reached, 
group  D  employees  shall  receive  comp  time  and  one-half  for  authorized  hours  worked 
beyond 37.5 in a work week and on holidays.  

IT classifications in grades 15 and higher are in group D. 

Group D employees who terminate after 10/1/00, shall have any department level overtime 
hours accrued after that date paid off at straight time overtime. 

New P&A classifications established after 8/1/00 shall be placed in group D, unless the 
parties mutually agree otherwise. 

By  2/1/01,  previously  authorized  compensatory  time,  which  arose  prior  to  10/1/00,  [old 
compensatory  time]  shall  be  logged  onto  University  developed  forms  for  input  into  a 
compensatory time tracking system. Until the system is developed, these forms shall be 
kept  at  a  location  in  the  department  where  they  are  accessible  to  the  employee  and  the 
department. There must be mutual agreement between the supervisor and the employee, 
acknowledged by their signatures, certifying the number of authorized compensatory hours 
that are owed in order for this time to be transferred. 

Up  to  75  of  these  old  compensatory  hours  shall  be  transferred  into  the  central 
compensatory time tracking system. 

Old  compensatory  time  beyond  75  hours  may  be  converted  by  mutual  consent  at 
discounted straight time pay (i.e., 9 hours of comp time = 6 hours of straight time pay, or 
1.5:1) 

Old compensatory time, which exceeds 75 hours, must be drawn against first. Any of this 
old compensatory time, which has not been used or paid off at discounted straight time by 
9/30/2001, shall cease thereafter to be owed. Any new hours earned while there are still old 
hours in excess of 75, will be paid at straight time overtime until 9/30/01, at which time the 
old hours are expunged. 

Where the amount of old time does not exceed 75 hours, new overtime hours after 10/1/00 
shall  accrue  as  set  forth  in  article  25  for  group  D  employees.  These  new  hours,  upon 
exceeding 75, are to be paid at a straight time overtime rate. There shall be no payoff of old 
comp time for those who terminate prior to its utilization. 

Instances of perceived abuses relating to an employee not being allowed to utilize “old” 
comp time shall be subject to grievance challenge, but shall not be arbitrable.  The final 
determination of how “old” comp time shall be utilized, prior to its 9/30/01 expiration, shall 
 be subject to the determination of the Exec VP or that person’s designee. 

-34-
 

ARTICLE (26) MEAL ALLOWANCE FOR OVERTIME WORKED 
 
A. 

A cash meal allowance of $3.50 shall be provided whenever an Employee works more than two (2) 
hours overtime in a given day, excluding time taken from meals. 

In order to qualify for the cash meal allowance the overtime must be properly authorized. 

A meal allowance shall not be provided when an Employee works continuously for two (2) hours 
or more following his normal work day without taking time off for a meal. 

 
 
ARTICLE (27)  PAY PERIODS 
 
The  University  may  modify  the  payroll  periods  to  bi-weekly  or  semi-monthly.    The  Union  shall  be 
provided at least 60 days notice and the opportunity to discuss the impact.  These discussions may include 
topics such as, DTCU, United Way, Parking, Cash-in-lieu of medical insurance, retirement, adjustments 
for holidays, and number of days in a pay period.  These topics may not be all inclusive. 
 
 
ARTICLE (28)  COMPENSATION FOR SERVICE IN A HIGHER CLASSIFICATION 
 
A. 

In the event a Professional and Administrative Employee is promoted or individually re-classified 
to  a  higher  classification  under  the  terms  of  Article  15,  such  promotions  and  upward 
reclassifications, for persons moving 4 or more salary grades only, and previously earning between 
minimum and job rate, will provide for a minimum of a 10% salary increase.   

 

 
B. 
 
C. 

 

 

 
B. 

Promotional increases and upward reclassifications for employees earning between minimum and 
job rate will provide a 5% plus money to step salary increase, subject to the minimum of the grade. 
 
For  promotions  only  rather  than  reclassifications,  this  provision  shall  allow  departments  with 
sufficient  funding  to  provide  an  increase  to  a  step  of  more  than  5%,  but  not  beyond  job  rate, 
consistent with the University’s evaluation of their experience and qualifications. 

Promotional  and  upward  reclassifications  for  people  earning  above  job  rate  will  allow  for  a  5% 
increase per grade level increase but not exceed 10% in the case of multiple grade level increases, 
except  the  new  salary  will  not  be  less  than  the  job  rate  of  the  higher  classification.  
Promotions/Reclassifications from one schedule to another, at the same grade level, will allow for 
up to 5% plus money to step salary increase.  In all cases, a salary provided at the higher rate is not 
to exceed the maximum of the higher classification.  Employees below job rate will be placed at 
minimum or at the appropriate salary step.  The higher rate will be effective the first day of service 
in  the  higher  classification  or  from  the  date  the  position  is  re-classified, or from the date of the 
grievance challenging the improper classification. 

In the event a Professional and Administrative Employee fills a position in a higher classification 
on an interim basis for more than thirty (30) working days, and assumes the substantive duties of 
the higher classification, he/she shall receive the base rate of the higher classification, or 5% above 
his/her current rate, whichever is greater, provided the higher rate does not exceed the maximum of 
the assumed classification.  The higher rate of pay will be retroactive to the first day of service in 
the higher classification. 

-35-
 

Upon  the  Employee's  return  to  the  position  he/she  held  prior  to  the  interim  assignment,  salary 
currently in effect for that position will be resumed. 

In the event a Professional and Administrative Employee fills a position in a higher classification 
on  a  permanent  basis,  i.e.,  new  hire,  promotion,  transfer,  reclass,  he/she  would  be  eligible  to 
request a classification audit of their position only after six months of service in that position. 

 
 
ARTICLE (29)  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 
 
A. 

Employees  are  expected  to  give  at  least  two  (2)  weeks  written  notice  prior  to  effective  date  of 
resignation. 

An Employee failing to report for work for three (3) consecutive working days without notice to 
the Employer will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.  Exceptions may be made by mutual 
agreement between the University and the Union.

Employees  who  return  to  work  at  the  University  who  have  had  five  (5)  or  more  years  of 
continuous  service  with  the  University  will  be  on  probationary  status  for  ninety  (90)  days.  
Employees  with  less  than  five  (5)  years  of  continuous  service  who  return  to  work  with  the 
University will be on probationary status for six (6) months.

group major medical coverage elected by the deceased Employee (including covered dependent 
children  up  to  age  18  years)  provided  the  deceased  Employee  had  five  (5)  or  more  years 
continuous participation within the University's major medical program.  Election of this option for 
continued coverage shall be available for a period of thirty (30) days after the end of the  month in 
which  insured  Employee  expired.    The  group  rate  will  be  paid  in  full  by  the  survivor.    The 
University  shall  notify  the  surviving  dependent(s),  in  writing,  of  this  option.    This  option  for 
continued medical insurance terminates upon the remarriage of the survivor.

ARTICLE (42)  MANDATORY SICK LEAVE 
 
A. 

The University may, by direction of a designated physician or other appropriate health professional 
acting initially or pursuant to any Employee submitted medical statement, direct that an Employee 
be  placed  on  Mandatory  Sick  Leave  whenever  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to  indicate  that  the 
affected person is suffering from a physical and/or mental illness or disability sufficiently serious to 
affect materially such person's ability to properly fulfill the duties and responsibilities of his/her 
University position.      

The  executive  head  of  a  school,  college,  division,  or  other  unit  having  reason  to  believe  that 
grounds  appear  to  exist  for  the  issuance  of  such  a  directive  by  a  health  professional  shall  be 
obligated to bring the matter promptly to the attention of the Human Resources Division. 

-46-
 

In  the  event  an  Employee  disagrees  with  the  determination  of  the  University  designated health 
professional that the subject Employee is unable to work at his/her position, under this Article, 
he/she may submit medical reports from their physician.  If a dispute still exists the matter may be 
referred to the grievance procedure beginning at step 3.  At the request of either the University or 
the  Union,  the  matter,  including  all  prior  medical  evidence,  will  be  submitted  to  an  impartial 
physician mutually agreed to by the parties.  The report of the impartial physician will be binding 
upon  all  the  parties.    The  expenses  of  the  impartial  physician  shall  be  shared  equally  by  the 
University and the Union. 

Initial selection of the impartial physician shall be by agreement between the University physician 
and the Employee's physician.  In the event the physicians are not able to agree or in the event the 
University or the Union disagree because of the inordinate expense of an agreed to physician, the 
University and the Union will select the impartial physician from a list submitted by the University 
physician and the Employee's physician.

ARTICLE (45)  EXCUSED ABSENCE (PERSONAL ILLNESS, EMERGENCIES, SPECIAL 
NEEDS) 
 
A. 
 

Excused Absence With Pay 

A  Professional  and  Administrative  Employee  shall  be  granted  excused  absence  with  pay  for 
personal illness, emergencies and special needs.  Such absence is charged to the staff member's 
Illness/Disability Bank and shall be reported on the Payroll Exception Report.  Excused absence 
with pay will be granted for the following reasons: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Death of a member of the immediate family (up to five (5) consecutive working days). 

Attendance at the funeral of a person not in the immediate family (up to one (1) working 
day). 

Verified  emergency  care  of  a  parent,  spouse  or  child  under  the  age  of  18  (up  to  two 
consecutive working days).  The need for emergency care may be subject to verification 
and may be limited to urgent circumstances that are beyond the employee’s control to plan 
for in advance that relate to the serious health condition (as that term is defined in FMLA 
regulations) of the covered relation. 

Quarantine required as a result of exposure to a communicable disease. 

An emergency medical or dental appointment which is verified in writing by the treating 
physician or dentist. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 
 
5. 

6. 

Up to two (2) additional days during the contract year for any personal reason other than 
those listed above upon completion of six (6) months of service.   

 
Immediate family shall be defined as:  Husband, wife, mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter, 
grandmother, grandfather, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, daughter-in-
law, son-in-law and grandchildren. 

Aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins shall be considered members of the immediate family 
only if living in the Employee's immediate household. 

Where a situation exists, which is not covered by these relationships, determination will be made 
by the Division of Human Resources or its designee. 
 
Excessive absence due to personal illness, or absence authorized under the Family and Medical 
Leave Act, (FMLA), may require verification by medical authority, including one designated by 
the Human Resources Division, if so requested by the Administrative Head of the unit.  However, 
it is not the policy of the University to arbitrarily penalize Employees through the imposition of 
economic sanctions for occasional days off due to illness which do not abuse the purpose of the 
illness bank, nor is it the policy of the University to interpret each day of an extended illness, e.g. 
five (5) days off with the flu, as five (5) separate occurrences, but rather as one (1) occurrence. 

-48-
 

ARTICLE (46)  JURY DUTY 
 
A. 

An Employee called for jury duty, or whose appearance in court is required by subpoena, will be 
paid the difference between the fee paid by the court and his/her regular salary during the period 
served.  It shall also credit to the Employee's Retirement Fund the University's contribution against 
the court fee, provided the Employee matches it with his/her standard contribution. 

1. 

The Employee may, if he/she wishes, charge any of this time to his/her Vacation Bank and 
retain the court fee. 

To  request  University  pay  for  the  difference  between  payment  by  the  court  and  the  University 
salary, the staff member shall: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Bring the court summons to the Human Resources Division. 

Sign an affidavit that court fees he/she receives will be turned over to the University.

send Form 788B, the Payroll Exception Report, to the Payroll Department, listing dates of absence 
and reason for absence. 

NOTE:    If  the  staff  member  is  excused  from  court  appearance  for  any  work  day(s)  during  the 
period of court duty, he/she shall report for work at his/her University assignment.

to  work  on  their  regularly  scheduled  work  day  between  Christmas  and  New  Years  will  be  given 
compensatory time off at a later date, or pay in lieu at the discretion of the University.  Compensatory 
time, or pay in lieu thereof, shall be calculated as straight time for each hour worked and shall be paid in 
addition to the Employee's regular closure pay. 
 
Employees scheduled to work during closure shall receive advance notice of whether their compensation 
shall be in money or additional time off, along with when such compensation shall be paid or scheduled.  
Concerns about scheduling may be subject to discussion at special conference, but shall not be subject to 
the grievance procedure. 
 
The following are the Christmas/New Years' Holidays and "Closure" days:

An Employee who requests vacation time off at least sixty (60) days prior to reaching the accrual 
maximum and has such request denied by the University, will be assured that another vacation 
period will be established within that sixty (60) day period, in order to ensure that no vacation time 
is lost.  An Employee prevented from using vacation time during the sixty (60) day period (only by 
reason  of  extreme  operational  necessity)  will  be  paid  an  amount  equal  to  each  subsequent  lost 
accrual. 

-50-
 

Employees  will  be  required  to  submit  requests  for  vacation  only  up  to  a  maximum  of  one-
hundred-eighty (180) days prior to the start of a vacation.  This does not limit Employees from 
voluntarily submitting vacation requests more than one-hundred-eighty (180) days in advance of 
the start of a vacation. 

All  vacation  requests  must  be  responded  to  within  10  working  days  upon  submission  of  the 
request. 

If a pay day falls during an Employee's vacation of two (2) weeks or more, an advance check may 
be requested in writing from the Payroll Office in accordance with established procedures provided 
the written request is submitted to  
 
Payroll  at  least  ten  (10)  work  days  prior  to  date  of  issuance  of  advance  check.    In  emergency 
situations which preclude the ten (10) work day notice requirement, the Employee must submit 
such written request to Payroll at least five (5) work days prior to the date of issuance of advance 
check. 

Vacation  time  must  be  scheduled  with  the  appropriate  unit  supervisor  and  shall  be  granted  in 
accordance with the operational needs of the unit.  The University encourages vacation utilization 
and recognizes that unusual scheduling conflicts between personal and operational unit needs may 
occur.  When such situations would cause hardship or loss of accrual days, the matter should be 
immediately referred by the Union to the Human Resources Division for consideration. 

Employees who have reached at least ninety (90) percent of their maximum accrual of vacation 
time may be allowed to take up to two weeks of pay in lieu of vacation time off once a year.  The 
Employee must request the payment in lieu of a vacation time off request, and all paid time will be 
subtracted from an Employee's vacation accrual bank. 

Employees who leave the University after six (6) months of continuous full-time service shall be 
paid for unused vacation days at the time of their termination of employment. 

If at the time of layoff a bargaining unit member has an accumulated vacation bank, such bank 
shall be frozen and paid out in a lump sum following the effective date of layoff in lieu of vacation 
time off.

of the average cost increase for Single, 2-Person and Family coverage for the five HMO/PPO's plus 
an additional $7.50 per month subsidy for family coverage. 
 
An Employee wishing coverage under one of the plans must file application within the first month 
of employment.  The effective date of coverage is the first (1st) of the month following enrollment. 
 In  the  event  the  Employee  fails  to  apply  within  the  first  (1st)  month,  such  Employee  will  be 
required to wait until the first of the month following ninety (90) days after application or until the 
next open enrollment period, depending upon the plans' requirements. 

All staff members who qualify for retirement at age 55 from Wayne State University are entitled to 
maintain retiree health coverage. Retirees will be responsible for paying the required premium. 

Effective October 1, 1988, (or as soon thereafter as the University can effect the change) bargaining 
unit  members  shall  have  the  option  of  continuing  coverage  under  Blue  Cross/Blue  Shield, 
continuing coverage under one of the Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's) or of dropping 
coverage provided that the Employee is covered under an alternative health insurance plan (i.e. 
coverage under a spouse's plan), and specifically requests such an option in writing and documents 
the alternative coverage.   

An Employee who forgoes coverage under a University plan will receive from the University sixty 
dollars ($60.00) per month in lieu of medical insurance coverage. 
 
With the exceptions listed below, an Employee who elects not to be covered under a University 
plan and subsequently desires such coverage will be required to wait for such coverage until the 
first  (1st)  day  of  the  month  following  ninety  (90)  days  after  application  or  until  the  next  open 
enrollment period, depending upon the plan's requirement.  The exceptions to this waiting period 
are: 
 

1. 

The death of a spouse or other person with whose insurance plan the Employee 
maintains coverage; and 

2. 

The  Employee's  divorce  from  his/her  spouse  and  the  Employee  maintained 
coverage under his/her spouse's medical insurance. 

Where one of the exceptions listed above (death or divorce) occurs and the Employee is able to 
provide sufficient documentation thereof, the Employee may make application for coverage under 
one  of  the  University  plans  and  coverage  will  be  effective  on  the  first  (1st)  day  of  the  month 
following  application.    When  extenuating  circumstances  arise  that  are  not  covered  by  1.  and  2. 
above, the University will give due consideration to requests for exceptions to the waiting period. 

Effective  January  1,  2001,  P&A  members  may  choose  to  participate  in  the  Flexible  Spending 
Account Program.  The University will pay the administrative fee.

ARTICLE (51)  DENTAL INSURANCE 
 
A. 

The Employer shall provide dental care coverage to all non-probationary enrolled Employees as 
described in the contract between the Employer and Delta Dental of Michigan. 

The University, at no cost to the staff member, provides a program of disability income insurance. 

Participation begins after the staff member has completed three (3) full years of University service 
at the University. 
 
Benefits for an insured staff member begin after six (6) months of continuous total disability and 
continue for as long as the disability continues until the Employee reaches age 65. If, however, the 
disability commences after age 60, the benefits will continue until the Employee reaches age 70 or 
for five (5) years, whichever occurs first. 

Under this plan the individual will receive a monthly income benefit which, including any disability 
benefits  from  Social  Security  and  Workmen's  Compensation,  will  be  equal  to  66  2/3%  of  a 
person's basic salary up to a maximum of $5,000 per month, effective October 1, 2000. The income 
benefit is subject to increase 3% each year during disability. The monthly income benefit will never 
be less than $50.  It also provides for a waiver of annuity premiums for an insured staff member 
participating in the University Retirement Plan. 

The decision of the carrier is not grievable to the University.  However, should a dispute arise as to 
the validity of an individual claim, such matter may be raised by the Employee or the Union with 
the Human Resources Division. 

The Employer will pay the full cost of the basic and supplemental life insurance coverage.  Medical 
coverage will be subsidized by the Employer at the same rate as is provided to active Employees if 
the Employee desires coverage.

ARTICLE (53)  LIFE INSURANCE 
 
A. 

All  Professional  and  Administrative  Union  members  on  a  fractional  or  full-time  basis  will  be 
provided  with  $25,000  non-contributory  life  insurance.    Employees  may  purchase  additional 
amounts of supplemental life insurance at subsidized and graduated rates by election of Option 
No. 2 or 3 below.  All eligible Employees shall be entitled to elect one of the following: 

Option No. 1  $25,000 non-contributory insurance only. 

Option No. 2  $25,000 non-contributory insurance plus supplemental insurance equal to one times 

annual salary. 

Option No. 3  $25,000 non-contributory insurance plus supplemental insurance equal to two times 

annual salary. 

Employees  shall  have  the  privilege  of  conversion  of  the  remaining  amount  of  their  group  life 
insurance to any standard policy issued by the insurance company without physical examination.

B. 

 
C. 

 

 

 

 
 
  

Fractional and full-time Employees with two (2) years of University service and who have attained 
twenty-six  (26)  years  of  age  shall  be  eligible  to  participate  in  any  of  the  University  sponsored 
retirement programs with University contribution. 

Fractional  or  full-time  Employees,  immediately  upon  employment,  may  participate  in  the 
retirement program on an individual basis without University contribution until the time that they 
become eligible for the University contribution. 

 
B.  Wayne  State  University  retirement  benefits  are  provided  through  annuity  contracts  with  the 
Teachers  Insurance  and  Annuity  Association-College  Retirement  Equities  Fund  (TIAA-CREF), 
and  custodial  accounts  with  Fidelity  Investments.    The  University  shall  offer  the  full  range  of 
investment options available through each of the retirement programs without restriction.  Both 
employee and university contributions to TIAA-CREF and Fidelity are immediately vested and full 
funded. 

A retiree shall be defined as an Employee who retires from the University, and 
 
1. 

Has  participated  in  the  WSU  Retirement  Program  and  has  received  the  University 
contribution for at least five (5) years. 

 

or 

Has at least ten (10) years of University service, and 

2. 

Has attained the age of fifty-five (55). 

-54-
 

Upon the recommendation of the appropriate Senior Officer, the President or his/her designee may 
offer  other  special  retirement  incentives  to  individual  members  of  the  bargaining  unit.    The 
University's  implementation  of  any  such  retirement  arrangement  shall  be  reported  to  the 
appropriate University departments, the Department of Labor Relations and to the Union. 

Retirees  shall  be  entitled  to  the  following  benefits  provided  the  retiree  notifies  the  Employer  in 
writing of the intent to retire at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of retirement. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Life insurance (currently $2500) coverage with the premium paid in full by the Employer. 

Continued medical coverage providing the retiree pays the full monthly premium. 

Payment of one-half (½) of the accumulated Illness/Disability Bank up to a maximum of 
thirty (30) days pay. 

Accrued Vacation Bank must be used prior to the effective date of retirement. 

Health Care Study Committee 
The parties recognize the substantial cost of providing retiree health insurance, the complexity of 
the  issue  and  how  a  thorough  analysis  would  take  more  time  than  the  parties  could  prudently 
devote during the summer of 2000.  Therefore a 2x2, or by mutual agreement 3x3 study committee 
will  meet  to  examine  the  issue  and  make  recommendations  to  the  University  and  the  Union’s 
executive committee on how this issue should be addressed.

ARTICLE (55)  TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
 
A. 

As part of the University policy to encourage staff members to further their formal education, the 
Tuition Assistance Program for Employees was established.  Under the Tuition Assistance plan, 
qualified  Employees  will  be  issued  vouchers  which  will  enable  them  to  register  without  paying 
tuition.  (Incidental fees, however, must be paid by the Employee.) 

1. 

2. 

Full-time Employees will be provided tuition assistance for two (2) courses or six (6) credit 
hours, whichever is greater, per semester for three semesters during the academic year. 

Represented  fractional-time  Employees  as  defined  in  Article  1  will  be  provided  tuition 
assistance for one (1) course or four (4) credit hours, whichever is greater, per semester for 
three  semesters  during  the  academic  year,  subject  to  a  maximum  benefit  of  twelve  (12) 
credit hours per academic year. 

There  will  be  no  waiting  period  for  eligibility  of  Employees.  To  assure  that  Employees  are  not 
assessed 
their  application  with  Benefits 
Administration not later than three (3) weeks prior to the start of class(es). 

late  fee(s),  participating  Employees  must  file 

The Tuition Assistance Program will provide eligible Employees with Tuition Fee Credential Cards 
which are to be used in lieu of tuition payments.  As in the past, tuition assistance will apply to 
tuition  fees  only.    Incidental  fees  such  as  laboratory  fees,  etc.,  which  may  be  charged  are  the 
responsibility of the Employee.  Failure to meet and maintain the eligibility requirements for tuition 
assistance  will  result  in  the  benefit  forfeiture  and  the  benefit  amount  will  be  recovered  by

appropriate means, i.e., payment, voluntary payroll deduction, etc. 
Failure to submit an application for tuition assistance and/or the reduced tuition benefit for spouses 
and children before the end of the term will forfeit eligibility under the program for that term. 

Eligibility: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

All full/fractional time salaried Employees on the Wayne State University payroll as of the 
last day of Final Registration.  It will be the responsibility of the Dean or Division Head to 
verify eligibility. 

College admission requirements must be met. 

Courses must be taken after normal working hours unless the Dean/Division Head verifies: 

a) 

b) 

c) 

The course is offered only during working hours. 

The supervisor is able to arrange adequate coverage of the position. 

Time taken off is charged to vacation or additional hours are worked to make it up. 
(Working during lunch will not satisfy the make-up arrangement.) 

Any  Employee  who  is  terminated,  leaves  employment  with  the  University  during  the  term  of 
tuition assistance, not including layoff or leave of absence, or who fails to successfully complete a 
course  in  which  they  enroll,  will  thereby  forfeit  their  tuition  assistance  for  said  course  and  be 
required to reimburse the University promptly for the appropriate amount of tuition and any other 
applicable  fees.  Failure  to  remit  the  total  amount  due  will  render  the  Employee  ineligible  for 
continued participation in the Tuition Assistance Program. 

Any  Employee  required  to  reimburse  the  University  may,  upon  receipt  of  a  bill  indicating  the 
balance due, exercise the option of (1) paying the balance in full upon receipt of the bill or (2) 
contacting the Department of Student Accounts Receivable within 20 days from the issue date of 
the bill in order to make arrangements for payment of the balance due.  When such arrangement is 
made, the Employee will be required to make an initial payment towards the balance at that time. 
 
In  the  event  no  payment  arrangements  are  made  or  the  Employee  fails  to  adhere  to  any  such 
arrangement, the University may deduct monies owed from an Employee's payroll check up to a 
maximum of 10% of the Employee's net check after the deduction of taxes, medical premiums and 
life insurance premiums. 

Upon the separation of any Employee who has a balance owing, the University may fully recoup 
that  balance  through  payroll  deduction.    Upon  the  layoff  of  any  Employee  who  has  a  balance 
owing, the University may recoup monies owed through payroll deduction, up to a maximum of 
10%  of  the  Employee's  net  check  after  the  deduction  of  taxes,  medical  premiums,  and  life 
insurance premiums. 

The  application  forms  and  Tuition  Fee  Credential  Cards  will  be  available  at  the  Benefits 
Administration Office, as well as any additional information that may be necessary. 

Graduate school  tuition assistance shall be subject to applicable taxation requirements, if any, of

the Internal Revenue Service. 

Passing grade must be obtained. A passing grade is a "D" or better for undergraduates and a "C" or 
better for graduates. A grade of "S" or "P" is also considered passing for classes graded Pass/Fail or 
Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory.  

Grades of I & Y must be converted in accordance with Student Requirements.  

Graduate  Tuition  Assistance  for  dissertation,  thesis,  essay  or  other  unstructured  courses  (for 
example, BCH 796 Research or CED Internship) is limited to a maximum of 8 credit hours per 
term.  

Graduate Tuition Assistance for Medical School will be set at the cost of graduate tuition in the 
College of Science.

ARTICLE (57)  CLASSIFICATION/COMPENSATION SYSTEM --SALARY 
ADMINISTRATION PRINCIPLES 
 
A. 

Positions included in the Hay classification system are assigned to an appropriate salary grade.  
Each Hay salary grade has a minimum, job rate and maximum.  The job rate is 96% of the mid-
point of the range.  Additionally, there are two intermediary steps between minimum and job rate.  
(To identify step amount - divide the difference between the minimum and job rate by three (3).) 

 
B. 

 

 

1) 

2) 

3) 

Employees will be placed on the salary range appropriate to their classification hire date.  
To achieve this, effective August 1, 1993, Employees will be moved to the step appropriate 
for their classification hire date. 

For the purposes of implementation only, time spent on unpaid leaves of absence will be 
counted as time served in the classification held prior to the beginning of the leave. 

Beginning August 1, 1993, step adjustments will be awarded to those eligible Employees 
who receive a satisfactory (fully satisfactory per 1992 review point) or above performance 
evaluation.    Eligible  Employees  between  minimum  and  job  rate  will  move  to  the  step 
appropriate  for  their  classification  hire  date  given  a  fully  satisfactory  performance 
evaluation.  The appropriate salary step shall be determined by the classification seniority 
of  the  incumbent.    As  an  example,  for  employees  with  two  full  years  of  classification 
seniority as of August 1 of the contract year, the appropriate step is step 2.  For employees 
with more than one year of Classification seniority but less than two years classification

seniority as of August 1 of a contract year, the appropriate step is step 1.  One step a year 
for each year of satisfactory service in classification, supported by the annual performance 
evaluation form. 

4) 

The  decision  to  postpone  or  defer  a  step  increase  for  an  Employee  with  less  than 
satisfactory performance is at the University's discretion.  Such decision is not subject to 
grievance  challenge.    Should  such  an  employee  receive  at  least  a  fully  satisfactory 
evaluation the following year, the employee will receive a one step increase instead of a two 
step increase. 

 
Unless specifically negotiated otherwise, steps move upward with any upward movement of the 
salary schedule due to the amount of any across-the-board (ATB) granted. 

Progression from job rate to maximum will occur by annual across-the-board and merit increases 
only.  There will be no progression beyond the maximum.   

Employees at maximum will receive any annual ATB and merit increases with merit awards paid in 
a lump sum and not added to base salary.  Employees above the maximum and who fall within 
their respective salary range as a result of the ATB to the range shall receive only that portion of the 
ATB that brings them to the new maximum of their respective range. 

Employees above maximum will not be entitled to receive ATB increases, but will be eligible for 
increases which would be paid in a lump sum payment, not added to their base pay. 

Employees participating in the retirement plan, at the time the lump sum payment is made, will 
have the normal University contribution to retirement based on that lump sum and will be required 
to make appropriate employee contribution from that lump sum. 

New hires placed into vacant bargaining unit positions will be offered a salary that would place 
them  on  a  step  (i.e.,  minimum,  first  step,  second  step,  job  rate)  in  the  salary  range  for  their 
classification. 

For  classifications  designated  as  high  demand  by  the  Division  of  Human  Resources,  or  for 
individuals with specialized skills, departments may hire at a point up to the midpoint of the merit 
range, i.e., halfway between job rate and the maximum. 

In the event a bonus is awarded to all persons represented by the bargaining unit, all Employees, 
including those above maximum, will be entitled to receive the bonus. 

 

Employees who receive transfers (i.e., same classification and/or salary schedule and grade) will 
maintain their current salary provided it does not exceed the maximum of their classification. 

All  Employees,  including  those  above  maximum,  may  be  entitled  to  receive  bonuses  at  the 
University's discretion in recognition of special responsibilities or performance. These discretionary 
bonuses, include, but are not limited to presidential awards. 

Performance related compensation, i.e., merit increases and bonuses (including, but not limited to 
presidential  awards)  is  not  subject  to  grievance  challenge.  Those  rated  at  or  above  a  Full 
Satisfactory overall rating are eligible to be considered for performance related compensation. 

-60-
 

 

 
M. 

 
N. 

If additional dollars become available for merit during the life of the Agreement, the University 
may establish a merit pool for distribution at its discretion. 

Employees currently represented by the Bargaining Unit, who, pursuant to the Hay Study would 
be placed into classifications that will not be represented by P & A, will remain in the Bargaining 
Unit in the revised classification, provided that they continue to hold such classification.  At the 
point that such positions become vacant, personnel newly placed into such positions will no longer 
be represented by the Bargaining Unit. 

 
 
ARTICLE (58)  COMPENSATION ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBILITY      
 
Hay implementation and administration shall be the responsibility of the Department of Classification and 
Compensation. 
 
 
ARTICLE (59)  WORKERS' COMPENSATION   
 
The  Employer,  in  accordance  with  statutory  requirements,  provides  workers'  compensation,  if  an 
Employee is injured in the course of  
employment, by providing for a continuation of a portion of the Employee's wages. 
 
Workers' compensation benefits will be supplemented by illness days until they are exhausted to maintain 
regular  after  tax  net  income.  When  illness  days  are  exhausted,  accrued  vacation  days  will  be  used  to 
supplement workers' compensation benefits until the bank is exhausted.  Such illness or vacation days will 
be depleted on an hour-for-hour basis. 
 
Employees will not accrue additional vacation days, nor will the illness banks replenish, while they are 
receiving workers' compensation benefits. 
 
An Employee will have the right to return to his/her position, or a similar one, provided: 
 

a) 

a vacancy exists or the new incumbent has less classification seniority than the returning 
Employee, when the return is attempted within the period below. 

 

b) 

he/she is able to return to work within a time period equal to their length of service, but not 
to exceed two years, from the date of injury, or last day worked, whichever is first. 

 
The returned Employee placed in a lower classification, who applies for a transfer or promotion to his/her 
former classification, shall be given preferential consideration for such transfer or promotion. 
 
 

-61-
 

 

ARTICLE (60)  OVERPAYMENTS   
 
In  the  event  that  an  Employee  is  overpaid  by  the  University,  such  Employee  is  required  to  repay  the 
University promptly the amount of the overpayment. 
 
It  is  understood  that,  where  no  dispute  exists  as  to  the  overpayment  or  as  to  the  amount  owing,  the 
University may recoup the overpayment through payroll deductions.  Nothing contained in this Article 
shall preclude the parties from making alternate arrangements to repay the amount owing.   
 
 
ARTICLE (61) INVALIDITY 
 
In the event that any portion of this Agreement is declared to be or becomes inoperative under State or 
Federal law, the balance of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the parties hereto agree 
to meet and renegotiate the inoperative portion of the Agreement. 
 
 
ARTICLE (62) JOB AUDITS 
 
Job audits are to be  requested by an Employee, the Employer or the Union in the form of a memo and 
submitted to the Classification and Compensation Department.  If an Employee is submitting a request, 
they are to notify the Union directly. 
 
Upon  receipt  of  the  audit  request  memo,  the  Classification  and  Compensation  Department  will  send  a 
position  questionnaire  to  the  Employee.    The  Employee  is  to  complete  their  portion  of  the  position 
questionnaire within twenty (20) working days of receipt. The supervisor is to review and comment on 
their portion of the position questionnaire within ten (10) working days of receipt from the Employee (this 
includes discussion and resolution to significant differences between the Employee's and the supervisor's 
view  of  the  position)    after  which,  the  completed  questionnaire  is  forwarded  to  the  Classification  and 
Compensation Department. 
 
The Classification and Compensation Department will notify the Employee, the supervisor and the Union 
of all job audit recommendations. 
 
If the job audit recommendation results in a change in position classification, the effective date is when the 
completed questionnaire is received in the Classification and Compensation Department. 
 
 
ARTICLE (63) IT STUDY REOPENER 
 
The University may reopen the contract for negotiation of methods and moneys for implementing or starting to 
implement the IT study as it relates solely to the compensation of or reclassification of IT positions. This will be 
done  by  serving  certified  mail  notice  to  the  Union.    Negotiations  will  commence  within  30  days  of  the 
University’s involving of the reopener.

ARTICLE (64)  CHANGE AND TERMINATION 
 
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the 31st day of July, 2002, and thereafter shall be 
renewed from year to year unless any party hereto shall notify the other party, in writing, not more than 
120 days and not less than 90 days prior to any anniversary date of this Agreement, of its desire to change 
in any way or to terminate the Agreement.  Such written notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail 
to the other party.  In the event such notice is given the parties shall begin negotiations within 45 days of 
notice.

Re:  Article 14-B2:  Recall of Laid-Off Employees 
 
Dear Mr. Crockatt: 
 
This  letter  is  intended  to  clarify  the  concerns  of  the  Union  and  the  University  in  regards  to  the 
interpretation and application of Article 14-B2. 
 
The  parties  agreed  that  in  those  rare  cases  of  severe  physical  disability  that  make  it  impossible  for  the 
Employee to respond or report to work within the specified time limits, it is not the intent of the University 
to terminate the Employee's recall rights. In other severe cases, the parties agree on request of the Union to 
meet and discuss the recall rights of particular Employees.

Re:  Christmas Closure - Article 48 
 
 
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
This letter will serve to update a previous Letter of Agreement, dated August 19, 1985, wherein the parties 
agreed as follows: 
 
The University shall permit employees to utilize available personal business days, vacation days, and/or a 
floating holiday for the 24th of December, 1992.  This is provided that prior notification is made upon 
request and the operational needs of the Department can be met.

Belcrest Hotel, Suite 1101 
5440 Cass Avenue 
Detroit, Michigan 48202 
 
Re:  Auditing Classes 
 
Dear Mr. Crockatt: 
 
You  have  requested  that  the  University  consider  a  proposal  to  allow  members  of  the  Professional  and  Administrative 
Union  the  right  to  audit  classes.    This  privilege  is  not  afforded  Employees  under  the  provisions  of  the  University's 
Tuition Refund Program. 
 
There are two methods which an Employee may use in order to audit a class: 
 
1. 

To audit a course, a student indicates at the time of registration for the course that he does not wish to receive 
credit.  His registration as an auditor is subject to the following regulations: 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
2. 

a. 

b. 

All students must pay the fees established for such registrations, which are the same as for courses elected 
for credit; 

A formal, written approval on the face of the program request is required.  Such approval is granted by the 
Dean or his delegated representative; 

c. 

An auditor will not normally be allowed to take quizzes and examinations. 

The second University policy concerning the auditing of classes is that an Employee may be permitted to audit 
(without fee assessment) a class providing he secures prior consent of the instructor and is willing to comply with 
the terms and conditions for auditing as determined by that instructor. 

 
In  an  effort  to  meet  your  request  with  respect  to  "Auditing,"  the  University's  Negotiating  Team  suggests  that  the 
membership  of  the  Professional  and  Administrative  Union  exercise  one  of  the  two  options  for  auditing  as  described 
above. 
 

Very truly yours, 
Philip E. Heideman 
Assistant Vice President 
for Human Resources

Re:  Article (24) Work Day and Work Week 
 
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
During these negotiations, the parties agreed that Library Assistants newly assigned to the circulation desk 
in Purdy Library on/after August 1, 1985, would be subject to work seven day operation schedules while 
employees  who  were  previously  assigned  to  the  circulation  desk  in  Purdy  Library  would  be 
"grandfathered" in under the previously existing contract language requiring a Monday-Friday work week 
with overtime for weekend work. 
 
The  Parties  hereby  agree  that,  until  such  time  as  sufficient  full-time Library Assistants are available in 
Purdy Library to work seven-day operation schedules and provide appropriate coverage at the circulation 
desk, the University will employ part-time personnel to  provide circulation desk coverage on weekends. 
Such part-time personnel shall have the qualifications and the ability to do the work.

Re:  9/10 Month Employees 
 
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
This  letter  of  understanding  supplements  the  1984-1986  agreement  between  Wayne  State  University  and  the  Professional  and 
Administrative Union, UAW Local 1979 and allows for the establishment of 9/10 month positions subject to the following: 
 
A. 

Employees  who  are  either  hired  or  volunteer  for  posted  nine  or  ten  month  positions  in  classifications  represented  by  the 
Professional and Administrative Union shall be represented by the Union.  No current University Employees will be required 
to accept a change from full time to 9/10 month status, including placement due to layoff pursuant to the provisions of Article 
(14). 

No 9/10 month position will be established where the regular work load for that position exceeds a nine or ten month duration. 

9/10 month Employees are eligible for the following benefits on a pro-rated basis:  vacation, illness bank, and retirement. 

9/10 month Employees are eligible for subsidized life and medical insurance to the same extent that 12 month Employees are 
subsidized.  However, accelerated payroll deductions, if any, will be made in order to provide protection during the months 
the Employee is off work. 

9/10 month Employees will be placed on leave of absence for the months  not employed or use his/her accrued vacation and 
will be returned to employment at the ends of such leaves.  Such leaves shall in no way cause a break in continuous service for 
the purpose of establishing fringe benefit eligibility. 

The University agrees to notify the Union prior to the establishment of any nine/ten month position and meet with the Union, 
upon request, to discuss whether the position meets the criteria as outlined above.

Re:  Training and New Technology 
 
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
Based  upon  substantial  discussion  during  these  negotiations  regarding  the  Union's  concern  as  to  the

that  operational  needs  and  financial  resources  permit,  requests  of  Employees  to  attend  seminars  that

Re:  Classifications Not Reviewed Pursuant To The Classification Study 
 
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
The  following  list  of  classifications  constitutes  those  classifications  which  are  represented  by  the 
bargaining unit but were not reviewed pursuant to the classification and compensation study. 
 
Accordingly,  the  University  agrees  that  in  the  event  a  position  exists  in  the  future  which  resumes  the 
performance of such duties, the job will be reviewed and slotted into the appropriate grade and schedule. 
 
If  such  review  indicates  that  the  position  should  be  placed  on  schedule  B  or  C  of  the  Classification 
Schedule, the position will be represented by the bargaining unit.  If the positions should be placed on 
Schedule A, the classification will not be represented by the Union, however, the Employee placed into 
the  position  will  be  represented  by  the  Union  during  the  time  he/she  holds  such  position.    When  the 
position becomes vacant, it will be filled with non-bargaining unit personnel. 
 
The above-referenced list of classifications is as follows:

Re:  Career Ladders 
 
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
During the course of these negotiations, considerable discussion was had regarding the concept of career 
ladders. 
 
The University encourages Employees to seek advancement opportunities to positions of greater 
responsibility and further encourages Employees to take advantage of the broad range of educational 
opportunities provided by the Tuition Assistance Program. 
 
The University will continue to make efforts to provide a wide variety of training programs to be offered 
through the Department of Training, Division of Human Resources, and hopes that Employees will avail 
themselves of such programs thereby enhancing individual growth and development.  The University 
would benefit from the more efficient use of Employee capabilities.  The expected advantages and result 
would provide the University with higher morale, improved staff retention, and a better trained job pool.

RE:  Training Opportunities 
 
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
In recognition of the mutual benefit accruing from the development of a highly trained work force, the 
University agrees that, to the extent that operational needs and financial resources permit, requests of 
employees to attend Wayne State University training programs that specifically relate to their duties 
should be considered and encouraged.  In addition, any other training that is not directly related to an 
Employee's current job but is offered on-site, should also be considered and encouraged to better prepare 
an Employee for career growth and development.

RE:  Contractors/Consultants 
 
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
Based upon substantial discussion during these negotiations regarding the Union's concern on the use of 
contractors, consultants, and/or subcontractors performing P&A work or supervising bargaining unit 
members, the University agrees to meetings between the Union and the senior administrative officials of 
C&IT in order to address concerns the Union has regarding, but not limited to, assignment of work, recall, 
cost, and production of work. 
 
The parties agree to discuss and explore ideas on containing costs and methods of retaining the knowledge 
base accumulated by contractors, consultants and/or subcontractors. 
 
By agreeing to meet and/or agreeing to alternatives which may be proposed by the unit, the University 
does not waive its right to hire contractors, subcontractors and/or consultants to perform any work 
deemed necessary by the University. 
 

Sincerely, 

Gail M. Wilson

RE: Performance Management and Merit Principles 
  
Dear Ms. Ray: 
 
The parties agree to the following principles and methods of starting to achieve these principles relating to performance 
management and merit pay. 
 
Performance Management 
 
1) 

Performance appraisals should not contain surprises. Regular performance achievement monitoring is encouraged, 
including the use of interim (nonmandatory) reviews that may be more frequent than annually. Effective 
performance management requires ongoing two-way communication to reach an understanding on goals and time-
lines. Additionally, there should be an advance understanding of the employee's specific objectives and job 
responsibilities. 

Efforts will be encouraged to train P&A employees, especially those with supervisory duties, and nonrep 
managers in performance appraisal principles. Such training serves to improve the sometimes supervisory and 
work leader roles of P&A employees over their subordinates as well as facilitating the improvement of their own 
performance. 

During the life of the agreement following the date of this letter, the parties shall set up a joint committee (up to 
five on five, appointed by the Union President and the Asst. Vice President of Human Resources) for the purpose 
of refining the performance appraisal forms currently used for P&A employees. The purpose of the committee 
shall be to recommend to the administration  needed revisions to the performance management process and the 
accompanying training and communications.  

The parties recognize the need for more supervisory training and work planning to facilitate a fair and effective 
performance management system.  Therefore, a study committee shall be convened by early 1999 to consider the 
following topics (all of which need not be considered): 

a) Performance management 
b) Work planning and project management

Merit Principles 
 
1) 

 

 
4. 

 
2) 

 
3) 

 
4) 

 

 

The study committee shall have up to four representatives from P&A and four appointed by the  
Administration.  The committee shall issue a report to the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources and  
Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration to include mid-term and long-term recommendations  
to improve performance management. 

Performance appraisals should ordinarily be conducted by the immediate supervisor. As a check on quality and 
prior to permanent filing, appraisal forms will be reviewed by the appropriate employees in Human Resources or 
the designee of the Asst. Vice President for Human Resources. 

The job rate can be the appropriate rate for employees whose performance is fully satisfactory and fully meeting 
the requirements of their positions.  

Subject to the funds availability of such merit pools as may be negotiated, those who far exceed the requirements 
of their positions (e.g., "outstanding") should advance more rapidly towards the maximum of their salary range 
than others. Those who are fully satisfactory are not precluded from advancement. 

As an added check on the appropriateness of distribution, the merit increases or bonuses recommended by 
managers shall be subject to review by the Human Resources or such other entity or person as designated by the 
Administration. 

For the duration of the 1995-1997 agreement, a three person, union merit monitoring committee, including the 
P&A President and two others shall be established. Its purpose shall be to review operation of merit increases by 
receiving a copy of the distribution in advance along with a summary of the distribution of ratings for P&A 
employees that does not identify individuals by name. The committee may meet with the University at special 
conference to review concerns about the workings of the merit system and it may inspect reviews then. Its 
purpose shall not be to address or negotiate specific increases. 

Sincerely, 

Bruce J. Gluski 
Contract Administrator
