Article I 

  

Term of Agreement 

This agreement shall become effective on the first day of the fall semester of the 
2000-2001 academic year, and shall terminate the day immediately preceding the 
first day of the fall semester of the 2004-2005 academic year. If Local 1810, 
American Federation of Teachers, is the bargaining agent for the succeeding year, 
2004-2005, then the agreement for the academic year 2004-2005 is to be 
negotiated during the 2003-2004 academic year. 
 
 
 
 

Article II

The Board recognizes the Federation as the bargaining agent in these areas: salary, 
sick leave, personal leave, hospitalization and life insurance, sabbatical leave, tenure 
grievance policy, number of preparations, class size in relation to the teaching 
situation, contact hours, and seniority in special assignments. 
The term "teacher" as used in this agreement shall refer to all employees in the 
bargaining unit represented by the Federation. 
Nothing herein shall require any teachers to be a member of the Federation. 
 
 
 
 

Article III 

  

Seniority in Special Assignments 

A. Seniority 
Seniority is to be calculated beginning with the first working day of the teacher's first 
full-time contract with District 513, with the exception of those teachers who 
previously held District 120 contracts. For those teachers, seniority is calculated 
beginning with the first year of a continuous period of teaching which includes at 
least six (6) hours of college level courses per year. 
In case of an extended leave due to illness, a teacher will be given a full-year 
seniority credit only if he has taught a period equal to one college semester. 
A complete seniority list by divisions shall be posted within thirty (30) days after the 
beginning of the fall semester. 
  
B. Assignments 
In all teacher assignments, other things (experience, preparation, special 
competence required for given assignment, etc.) being equal, seniority will be given 
preference. 
A list of assignments beyond the normal load shall be made available to the teachers 
within ten (10) days after the start of the fall semester and the spring semester. 
Should questions arise concerning such assignments, they shall be subject to review 
by the President, or his/her designee, with the teacher concerned and a 
representative of the Federation. 
 
 
 
 

Article IV 

  

Work Load 

A. Work Load - Teaching Faculty 
Earnest effort shall be made to prepare teaching schedules for each semester in 
accordance with the following ideal standards: 
1. For the program which includes 5-hour, 4-hour, 3-hour, and 2-hour course in any 
combination, the annual load will be thirty (30) hours. Normally, the semester load 
will be fifteen (15) hours, but the annual thirty-hour (30) load may be distributed 
unequally between the two semesters: e.g., eighteen (18) hours the first semester 
and twelve (12) hours the second semester. All hours in excess of the annual thirty 
(30) hours, however, will constitute an overload. Overload payments shall be 
included with the regular February payroll.  
2. In order to provide greater work load flexibility for tenured faculty and more 
staffing options for the College, the following alternatives to the traditional fall/spring 
semester schedule are available: 

a. Alternative Options for Making Load. Subject to 
receiving prior approval as specified below, a faculty 
member may opt to spread his/her full-time teaching 
load over three semesters. Faculty may opt to satisfy 
their load by teaching in any two of three semesters or 
by teaching in all three semesters. Office hours will be 
pro-rated, based on the percentage of load taught 
during a semester, including pre-summer or summer 
session. If a faculty member intends to but does not 
make load during the regular academic year (fall/spring 
semesters), he or she may also be able to teach during 
the following pre-summer or summer sessions, subject 
to availability and approval, and thereby retaining 
his/her full time faculty status. 

b. Procedures for Obtaining Approval. A faculty member 
who intends to make load by teaching outside the 
regular academic year shall submit a written proposal 
and obtain approval from his/her division chair and the 
Vice President for Academic Affairs. If the faculty 
member intends to teach less than a full load in the fall, 
the proposal must be submitted by February 1 of the 
preceding academic year. If the faculty member intends 
to teach less than a full load in the spring, the proposal 
must be submitted by May 15 of the preceding academic 
year. 

A load agreement shall be signed by the faculty 
member, the Federation president, and the Vice 
President for Academic Affairs. Ability to offer and staff 
classes will be a primary issue in considering proposals 
for a flexible schedule. Flexible load schedules shall not 
span two academic years (an academic year begins with 
the fall semester and ends at the conclusion of summer 

semester). The vice president may waive proposal 
deadlines in extenuating circumstances. 

c. If a faculty member teaches during the pre-summer 
or summer sessions in order to make load, overload pay 
for the academic year will be calculated at the beginning 
of the regular summer session. 

3. In determining load, one laboratory hour and one clinical hour shall be counted as 
equivalent to 0.75 times a class hour. However, for purposes of compensation for 
full-time instructors, one clinical hour shall be counted as equivalent to 0.85 times a 
class hour. "Clinical" is defined as supervision of nursing students in the provision of 
patient care in health care facilities. For purposes of compensation for full-time 
instructors, one closed lab hour shall be counted as equivalent to 0.80 times a class 
hour. "Closed laboratory" is defined as laboratory instruction involving a setting in 
which students are assigned to a specific lab section of a course that meets at a 
specific time each week. 
4. Class preparations will normally be limited to two, with three as a maximum. The 
work load shall include an announced and posted schedule of seven and one-half 
(7.5) conference hours per week when the teacher is regularly available to the 
students. These are not counted as contact hours. 
5. Regular classes will be limited to thirty-five (35) students per instructor excepting: 

Business Communications 
Communications I 
Communications II 
English Composition & Speech 
Seminars 
Laboratory Sections 
Developmental Courses 
Large Lecture Sections 

25-student limit 
25-student limit 
25-student limit 
25-student limit 
15-student limit 
20-student limit 
20-student limit 
120-student limit 

  
6. A "large lecture section" provides a structure, such as supplementation by 
seminars, that maintains student/instructor ratios and ensures student learning and 
performance. 
  
B. Work Load - Counselors 
Counselors shall be available for a work week and work year as scheduled by the 
Vice President of Student Services. If individual counselors are required to work 
beyond the number of duty days in the school calendar, they will be compensated at 
$130 per day. By July 1, the Vice President of Student Services will provide the 
counselors with a tentative schedule detailing their work week and work year for that 
fiscal year. In the event that unforeseen events necessitate changes in individual 
schedules, the Vice President of Student Services will notify the affected employee at 
the earliest possible date of the needed change. 
  
C. Work Load – Laboratory Instructors 
Individuals with an associate, baccalaureate or advanced degree may be employed 
as laboratory instructors. The work load for laboratory instructors will be 30 hours 
per week, plus five (5) student conference hours per week. Beginning with the 2001 
contract year, laboratory instructors shall enjoy all rights and privileges of this 
contract. 
 

Article V 

  

Instructor Rights 

Official faculty files in the college personnel office shall be maintained under the 
following circumstances: 

1. No material derogatory to an instructor's conduct, service, 
character, or personality shall be placed in the file unless the instructor 
has had an opportunity to read the material by affixing his/her 
signature on the copy to be filed, with the understanding that such 
signature merely signifies that he/she has read the material to be filed 
and does not necessarily indicate agreement with the contents. 

2. The instructor shall have the right to answer any material filed and 
his/her answer shall be attached to the file copy. 

3. Upon written request by the instructor, he/she shall be permitted to 
examine in the personnel office his/her official cumulative file (not 
his/her placement office credentials or confidential letters of 
recommendation sent to placement agencies and/or prospective 
employers and graduate schools), but he/she is not to mark, destroy, 
or remove any of the contents. 

Any written documents which are to be used as the basis for a 
reprimand, suspension, or dismissal must be included in an instructor's 
central personnel file. 

4. Upon written request, the instructor shall receive a copy of 
materials in his/her official cumulative file if such materials are to be 
used by the Board in any form of litigation. 

5. In the event that the instructor refuses to sign a statement to the effect that 
he/she has read material to be added to his/her file, the proper administrator shall 
notify the Federation President, who shall signify receipt of a copy of the material. 
The Federation President will forward a copy to the instructor. 
 
 
 
 

Article VI 

  

Intellectual Property 

A. Intellectual Property Rights 
This provision defines the respective rights of bargaining unit employees and the 
College in intellectual property made, created or developed by bargaining unit 
employees in connection with their employment by the College. Intellectual property 
rights are those which can be or have been trademarked, copyrighted, patented or 
that may otherwise exist in instructional, artistic, scholarly or tangible research 
material. 
B. Presumption of Employee Ownership 
Intellectual property created by an employee covered by this agreement shall be the 
sole and exclusive property of that employee for perpetuity. Such intellectual 
property shall continue to be used for the benefit of the college so long as the 
employees maintain employment at the college. Employees may negotiate with the 
college on an individual basis issues such as compensation, joint-ownership, or the 
disposition of the work if the individual’s contractual relationship with the college is 
altered (See Intellectual Property Agreement form). 
C. Exempted Scholarly Works 
The College specifically waives ownership rights to scholarly works to which 
academic institutions have traditionally waived such rights. Such works include, but 
are not limited to: 

1.  Textbooks,  
2.  Class notes,  
3.  Research proposals,  
4.  Course outlines, classroom presentations, and instructional material. "Course 
outline" is the version of the official syllabus developed for use by the faculty 
member in the classroom.  

5.  Innovative products or procedures (which may appear in a variety of forms, 

such as printed matter, slides, web-based productions or multimedia 
presentations) resulting from or enhancing the teaching/learning process. For 
example, such material includes research articles and monographs; student 
theses and dissertations; paintings, drawings and sculptures; musical 
compositions and performances; dramatic works and performances; poetry, 
fiction, or nonfiction; lab-based or technological innovations or instructional  

6.  procedures; or computer programs, languages or software.  

  
D. College Ownership 
1. Significant Use of Resources – The college will own any intellectual property 
(other than exempted scholarly works) that is made, discovered or created by a 
college employee who makes significant use of college resources (including college-
administered funds or college funded time, facilities, or equipment) in connection 
with the development of such intellectual property. The product of such "significant 
use" is work that does not have a primary classroom or educational purpose, and/or 
detracts from the quality of the teaching/learning process. Use of library facilities, 
other facilities available to the general public, and ordinary use of office equipment 
and office staff will not be considered "significant use" of college facilities and 
equipment.  
2. College Commissioned Works. Where intellectual property is made, discovered 
or developed under a specific agreement between a bargaining unit employee and 
the College and the agreement defines the obligations and ownership rights of each 
party, the agreement shall take precedence over any parts of this provision that may 
be inconsistent. 

3. Grant Funded Projects. Ownership of intellectual property that is made, 
discovered or created in the course of research or sponsored projects funded by 
grants will be governed by the terms of such grants or agreements, as approved by 
the college. 
4. College Right of Use. Intellectual property created by the employee in the 
fulfillment of the employee’s normal duties and responsibilities under this collective 
bargaining agreement is presumed to belong to the employee for proprietary or 
marketing purposes outside of the College, but is available to the college for internal 
program/course review, and for review by external governing, accrediting or funding 
agencies regulating the college. The College shall be entitled to benefit without 
further cost from the use of that property within the College for instructional or other 
educational purposes for the duration of the employee’s employment with the 
College. 
  
E. Sale of Intellectual Property 
Funds received by the college from the sale of intellectual property owned by the 
college shall be allocated and expended as determined solely by the college. 
Funds received by the employee from the sale of intellectual property owned by the 
employee shall be allocated and expended as determined solely by the employee. 
Funds received by the employee and by the college from the sale of intellectual 
property owned jointly by the employee and the college shall be allocated and 
expended in accordance with the specific agreement negotiated by the employee and 
the college concerning such jointly owned intellectual property. 
  
F. Obtaining Copyrights, Patents, or Trademarks 
It shall be the sole obligation of the owner of intellectual property under this 
provision to take appropriate legal steps to protect ownership of that property. This 
agreement is not intended to shift that responsibility to the Union or any other 
entity. If intellectual property is made, created or developed in a situation where it is 
reasonable to believe that joint ownership may exist, it is the obligation of both 
parties to consult with the other before taking any action to assert or protect 
ownership. 
  
G. Development Obligations 

1. The College supports the development, production, and 
dissemination of intellectual property by its employees so long as 
those efforts support and do not detract from employee job duties. 

2. Joint ownership will continue after termination of employment 
unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties. 

3. Recognizing that the development of distance learning classes and materials, web-
based courses and other innovative media and course materials benefits the College 
and its mission, the College may from time-to-time provide resources such as 
stipends and reassigned time and expenses to support such efforts by employees. 
Unless otherwise agreed, these resources will not be considered "significant" and will 
create no College ownership of resulting property. 
 
 
 
 

Article VII 

  

Leaves 

A. Annual Medical Leave 
Each full-time teacher shall be granted medical leave with pay as follows: Twenty 
(20) days per year for the first contract year; twelve (12) days per year for each 
year after the first contract year. Each full-time teacher shall be permitted to 
accumulate an unlimited number of medical leave days with pay. Faculty who teach 
summer school will receive two (2) days of medical leave. Medical days that become 
available as a result of summer school teaching will not accumulate. 
The Board reserves the right to request a physician's certificate that the teacher is 
incapacitated from performing his/her usual or ordinary duties for any medical leave 
taken. 
  
B. Personal Leave 
Each full-time teacher shall be granted three (3) days yearly, for personal leave. 
Unused personal leave will be accumulated as medical, not personal leave. Teachers 
shall notify their division Chair forty-eight (48) hours in advance, if practicable, of 
such leave so provisions can be made for the classes. 
  
C. Bereavement Leave 
When death occurs in his/her immediate family, i.e., spouse, parent, parent of 
current spouse, child, brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandparents, 
grandchildren, and legal guardians, a teacher, on request, will be excused for three 
(3) calendar days following the date of death. 
  
D. Family and Medical Leave Act Leave 
The College agrees to comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the 
rules and regulations issued in conjunction therewith. The College may adopt such 
policies as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the Family and Medical 
Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and the rules and regulations issued in conjunction 
therewith. Any such policy will not be deemed to be violation of this provision if it is 
mandated or legally permitted by the FMLA and the rules and regulations issued in 
conjunction therewith, except that the College will permit any teacher who requests 
FMLA leave for purposes of childbirth to designate up to six weeks of that leave as 
medical leave without the necessity of providing medical documentation of a serious 
health condition during that period. 
E. Military Leave. 
Any teacher drafted or recalled for military service shall be granted a military leave 
of absence. He/she may return to the college within ten (10) months after release 
from service except in the case of physical or mental incapabilities and/or 
dishonorable discharge. Notice of his/her intent to return shall be sent to the Board 
at least two (2) months prior to his/her return. On return from military leave, the 
teacher will be eligible for seniority and placement on the salary schedule in the 
position he/she would have attained during the leave period. 
  
F. Sabbatical Leave 
A sabbatical leave of absence may be granted for the purpose of study or travel to 

teachers who have taught full-time for six (6) or more years at Illinois Valley 
Community College. A teacher is eligible for consideration for leave after the sixth 
consecutive full year of teaching. Special consideration will be given to granting an 
out-of-sequence leave to a teacher enrolled in a doctoral program who may require 
such a leave to complete residence requirements. 
A teacher who has taken a sabbatical leave will not again be eligible until he/she has 
taught full-time for an additional successive six-year period. No more than three 
percent of the full-time faculty may be granted sabbatical leaves during the same 
academic year. Application for sabbatical leave shall be made in writing by the 
teacher requesting leave and submitted to the President of the college prior to March 
15, preceding the academic year for which leave is requested. The applicant will 
submit a statement describing the length of leave and the program he/she intends to 
follow during the leave. Recommendations for approval of requests for sabbatical 
leave shall be made to the Board by the President. The primary factor to be 
considered in granting sabbatical leave will be its relative benefit to the college, to 
the students, and to the teacher. 
The interest of District 513 shall be protected by a written agreement providing that 
the teacher will return to the service of the District and will render at least one year 
of service upon return from leave. If the teacher wishes to receive compensation 
while on leave, the Board may request a bond or written agreement, as appropriate, 
indemnifying the Board for the total salary paid in the event the teacher fails to 
return and render at least one year service in the employ of District 513 following 
the sabbatical leave. 
Teachers granted sabbatical leave for one semester shall be paid full salary during 
such leave. Teachers granted leave for one full year shall be paid one-half salary for 
the year in which leave is taken. The salary shall be paid in the same manner as if 
the teacher were teaching in District 513. The teacher may accept a fellowship or 
grant-in-aid in accomplishment of the purpose for which the leave was granted. Time 
spent on sabbatical leave shall be credited toward salary increment and seniority as 
time spent in full-time teaching. 
Upon completion of the sabbatical leave and within sixty (60) days of the teacher's 
return to duty, he/she shall submit to the President one of the following: 

If the leave was for formal study, a transcript of credit and a brief 
description of the program studied, including a detailed evaluation of 
the program with respect to its contribution to the leave; 

  

If the leave was for travel, a written report setting forth the teacher's 
reaction to the travel and a statement of the benefits received. 

  
G. Legal Leave 
An employee shall be excused from work for jury service. Such employee shall be 
paid his regular salary less the fee he/she received for jury duty. 
 
 
 
 
 

Article VIII 

  

No-Strike Pledge 

The Federation and the Board subscribe to the principle that any and all differences 
shall be resolved by orderly and appropriate means without interruption of the 
college program. The Federation, therefore, agrees that it will not instigate, engage 
in, support, encourage, or condone any strike, work stoppage, or other concerted 
refusal to perform work by the teachers covered by this agreement. Differences 
between the parties concerning the meaning, interpretation, or application of this 
agreement shall be resolved by utilization of the Grievance Procedure set forth in 
Article IX hereof, or by other lawful and orderly means available under the laws of 
the State of Illinois. The Board shall not engage in lockouts. 
 
 
 
 
 

Article IX 

  

Grievance Procedure 

Should any difference arise between the Board and any teacher or the Federation 
with respect to the meaning, interpretation, or application of a specific and identified 
provision of this agreement, it shall be resolved in accordance with the following 
procedure. This Procedure is intended to encourage resolution of differences through 
discussion of concerns and consideration of mutually agreeable options wherever 
possible and, where such discussions are not successful, to facilitate efficient 
processing of the grievance. Informal resolution of differences through discussion 
between teachers and their supervisors is encouraged. 

Step I 
A grievance shall be recognized and processed if it is reduced to 
writing and filed with the Vice President of Academic Affairs within 
twenty (20) working days following the occurrence of the event giving 
rise to the grievance. If the grievance concerns counseling staff, it 
shall be filed with the Vice President of Student Services. 

Either before a grievance is filed or soon thereafter, a conference shall 
be scheduled by the applicable Vice President (either Academic Affairs 
or Student Services). The aggrieved and the Federation shall be 
notified of the time and place of the conference. The participants in the 
meeting shall be agreed upon by the applicable Vice President or his or 

her designee and the aggrieved/Federation. If agreement on 
participants cannot be reached, the conference may be attended by 
the aggrieved and up to two Federation Representatives, 

the applicable Vice President or a designee and up to two additional 
administrators as designated by the applicable Vice President, except 
that the aggrieved may choose to participate without any intervention 
by the Federation. 

The purpose of the meeting shall be to clarify concerns and to explore 
options for resolving the issue by mutual agreement. If agreement 
cannot be reached, the participants shall discuss whether to modify 
any of the subsequent steps and timelines for processing the 
grievance. Any agreement to modify steps and timelines shall be 
reduced to writing between the Federation and the applicable Vice 
President. 

If this meeting does not resolve the matter, the applicable Vice 
President shall provide a written response either accepting or denying 
the grievance within ten (10) working days of the date the grievance is 
filed or the meeting is held, whichever is later. A denial shall include 
reasons for the denial. 

  

Step II 
If Step I does not provide a satisfactory solution, the grievant and the 
Federation may appeal in writing to the President of the College within 
seven (7) working days following receipt of written notice of the Vice 
President=s decision. The appeal shall state the nature of the 
grievance, the disposition and reasons offered by the Vice President, 
and reasons why they are unsatisfactory. The President shall schedule 
a conference on the matter and advise the teacher and the Federation 
of the time and place of the conference. If the grievance is not 
satisfactorily resolved at the conference, the President shall 
communicate his/her decision and reasons in writing to the aggrieved 
teacher and the Federation within ten (10) working days of the receipt 
of the written appeal. 

  

Step III 
Final appeal on any grievance shall be made in writing to the Board 
within seven (7) working days following receipt of the President=s 
decision. The appeal shall state the grievance, the disposition and 
reasons offered by the President and the reasons why they are 
unsatisfactory. The appeal and a complete written case history shall be 
presented at the first regular Board meeting following receipt of the 
appeal provided the regular meeting is scheduled within two (2) 
weeks; otherwise, a special Board meeting shall be called. The 
grievance shall be presented by the grievant or at the grievant=s 
choice by another member of the Federation. The grievant may be 

accompanied by up to five Federation Representatives. The Board=s 
decision shall be communicated in writing to the grievant and the 
Federation within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of the appeal. 

  

Step IV 
Should the Board's decision prove unacceptable, the Federation may 
initiate arbitration. An arbitrator shall be selected jointly by the Board 
and the Federation from a list of seven arbitrators who reside in Illinois 
and who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators 
requested from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. From 
the list furnished, the Board shall select three names and the 
Federation shall select three names. If more than one name appears 
on both lists, the choice will be made by lot. If the lists contain no 
common names, the final selection will be made by striking names 
alternately from the FMCS list (the first turn will be determined by lot) 
until only one name remains. 

The decision of the arbitrator will be accepted in good faith as final by 
the parties to the grievance, and both will abide by it. The arbitrator 
shall limit his/her decision strictly to 

the application and interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement 
as they apply to the specific grievance presented, and he/she shall be 
without power or authority to make any decision limiting or interfering 
in any way with the powers, duties, and responsibilities of the Board 
under applicable law. 

The administration or the Board may initiate a grievance, except the position of the 
parties shall be reversed. The absence of a denial of the grievance at any step within 
the designated time period shall function as a denial. 
The Federation, upon request, must represent all teaching personnel in the 
bargaining unit; however, any teacher or group of teachers has the right to present a 
grievance and seek adjustment without the intervention of the Federation 
representative. 
 
 
 
 

Article X 

  

Appointment and Tenure Provisions 

The objectives in establishing a tenure policy are to ensure an environment 
conducive to professional competence in teaching and to permit maximum security 
to the teachers consistent with effective operation. A tenure policy must not function 

to protect a faculty member who neglects his/her professional responsibilities but 
should provide for an atmosphere of freedom in keeping with his/her professional 
status. 
A teacher on tenure may be suspended or dismissed only by the Board and in 
accordance with the Illinois Community College Tenure Law. 
A. Reduction in Force 
Any teacher reinstated after a reduction in force will be reinstated at the same step 
or level as existed prior to the termination. 
B. Savings Clause 
In the event that the Illinois Community College Tenure Act is declared 
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, Article IX of the 1978-1980 
collective bargaining agreement shall be immediately effective in this contract. 
 
 
 
 

Article XI 

  

Hospitalization and Life Insurance 

District No. 513 will provide hospitalization and life insurance programs for 
employees and dependents based on the lowest and most responsible bidder. During 
the 2000-2001, 2001-2002, 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years, the Board 
agrees to pay 80 percent of all health benefits and the teaching personnel covered 
by this agreement will pay the remaining 20 percent. 
Life insurance for the 2000-2001, 2001-2002, 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school 
years will be $60,000. All four years will have Accidental Death and Dismemberment 
(AD&D). 
An employee will be allowed to continue the college's health insurance coverage, as 
the college recognizes COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) and 
adheres to the extension of benefits. At the end of the time period provided for in the 
act, a conversion policy is available through the college's health insurance company. 
Any full-time faculty member with 10 or more years of full-time service at IVCC who

the competence of the employee in service to the 
District. A proposal concerning such courses must be 
submitted in writing to the Vice President of Academic 
Affairs together with a statement relating the proposed 
work to the professional growth of the employee. The 
Vice President of Academic Affairs may request a review 
of the proposal by a committee comprised of the 
Division Chair, a representative in the area in which the 
proposed work is to be done, and the Vice President of 
Academic Affairs or his/her representative. Course work 
taken at the specific request of the District shall qualify 
under this category.

(3-5 days) of attendance.  

3. Approved Professional Development Plan 
A faculty member may advance laterally on the salary schedule based on 
the documented completion of an approved professional development 
plan, as follows:   

a. The faculty member must submit a written Professional 
Development Plan to the appropriate division chair. The plan will be 
reviewed by a committee consisting of, at a minimum, the faculty 

member’s division chair and another faculty member appointed by the 
Federation from outside of the faculty member’s discipline. Additional 
members may be appointed by agreement between the appropriate 
vice president and the Federation. The committee will make a 
recommendation to the appropriate vice president, who retains 
authority for final approval of the plan. The approved plan will be 
retained in the faculty member’s personnel file in the Human 
Resources Office. While a long-term plan involving movement over 
multiple columns may receive tentative approval, final approval will be 
limited to one column at a time.  

b. A professional development plan for advancement to Column G may 
be considered for a doctorate in an academic discipline, in higher 
education, or in community college education.  

c. A faculty member who has earned a terminal advanced degree less 
than a doctorate may submit a professional development plan for a 
masters degree in another discipline or in teaching and learning. Such 
a plan may be approved for advancement to Column G.  

d. The plan must outline a collection of integrated learning 
experiences, such as courses, workshops, seminars, internships, etc.  

e. The plan must include articulation of the faculty member’s 
educational/development goal, including proposed lateral placement 
on the salary schedule.  

f. For movement of one column, the proposed activities shall be 
equivalent to 15 semester hours of college or graduate coursework.  

g. The faculty member shall demonstrate how the integrated learning 
experiences proposed in the plan are intended to benefit the 
curriculum and the institution. Courses and other activities 
emphasizing new instructional methodologies and technologies are 
encouraged.  

h. The development plan may include learning experiences outside the 
faculty member’s discipline, as long as those experiences directly 
enhance teaching and learning at IVCC. A combination of "subject" and 
"related" learning experiences is encouraged.  

i. Proposals that do not receive approval will be returned to the faculty 
member with a written rationale.  

j. The faculty member may propose addenda to approved plans, 
subject to the approval process outlined above.  

Documentation of the completion of the approved plan must be provided before any 
salary schedule advancement is approved by the vice president. Where completion of 
an approved plan requires evaluation of the quality of the work produced by the 

faculty member, the appropriate vice president may seek input from other qualified 
faculty members. 
  
D. Initial Placement 
Employees shall be placed on the schedule in the column and on the step for which 
they qualify under Item B above. 
For all new employees, the factors of education, experience, ability, and value to the 
college will be considered in the determination of initial placement. Years of teaching 
experience and equivalent experience judged on the basis of applicability shall be 
recognized in this placement, but it cannot exceed a total of seven (7) vertical steps; 
i.e., a person having four years teaching experience and a Master's Degree will be 
placed at B-5; a person having seven or more years teaching experience and a 
Master's Degree will be placed at B-8. 
  
E. Vocational-Technical Personnel 
Every effort shall be made to employ teachers for occupationally oriented courses 
who offer academic as well as business or industrial experience. For initial placement 
on the salary schedule, years of occupational experience may be equated to steps on 
the salary schedule. 
For an individual holding an Associate Degree or equivalent, two (2) years of 
experience in work directly related to the teaching position considered will be used to 
place the individual on Step A-2 of the salary schedule. 
Anyone who was placed on the Master's Degree column prior to the school year 
1972-1973 shall retain his/her placement and eligibility for advancement as 
described in Section F, Article XII. 
  
F. Advancement 

1. An employee will be advanced in the column for which he/she 
qualified one step for each complete year of acceptable service, until 
he/she reaches the maximum salary for this column. The Board 
recognizes the following exception to this normal advance: Upon 
recommendation of the Division Chair, Vice President of Academic 
Affairs, and the President, the Board may grant a special merit 
advance equivalent to two steps in the appropriate column. 

2. On the basis of evidence supplied (i.e., official transcript) and 
approved, an employee shall be reclassified annually on October 1 by 
movement to the column for which he/she becomes qualified.

Article XIV 

  

Union Dues 

Check-off system for union dues is available upon written request of the teacher. 
 
 
 
 
 

Letter of Understanding 
Compensation for Collaborative 
Teaching 

  
Community College 513 (the "College") and the AFT Local 1810 (the "Union") agree 
to the following compensation guidelines for collaborative teaching, per the Letter of 
Agreement Regarding Pilot Programs in Non-Traditional Methods of Delivery of 
Instruction, attached to the 2000-2004 Collective Bargaining Agreement. These 
guidelines will be reviewed during the spring semester 2002. 
  

Definition of Collaborative Teaching 

Two or more instructors share responsibility for teaching the same section of a 
course (team teaching) or cooperate in the teaching of a cluster of linked or 
coordinated courses (learning community). They engage in joint planning, agree on 
the expected outcomes for the course or cluster of courses, and have equal 
responsibility for delivery of instruction and assessment of student learning. 
  

Compensation for Development 

Each faculty member involved in the development of a collaborative teaching 
arrangement will be granted one credit hour of overload pay on a one-time basis. 
  

Compensation for Delivery 

The first time a course or cluster of courses is taught collaboratively, each faculty 
member receives load credit for the entire course or for the component of the cluster 
that he/she is responsible for. 
The second and subsequent times the course or cluster of courses is taught, the load 
is calculated as follows: 

Team taught course: 

o  2 faculty team teaching—each credited with 2/3 of the credit hours of 

the course (for a 3CH course, that would be 2CH)  

o  3 faculty team teaching—each credited with ½ of the credit hours of 

the course (for a 3CH course, that would be 1.5CH of load)  

Linked courses (Learning Community): 

•  Each faculty member will receive full load credit for the course within the 

cluster that he/she generally teaches.  

•  A one-credit hour Learning Communities course will be part of each learning 
community. Each faculty member involved in teaching a learning community 
course will receive full load credit or overload pay for that one-credit course 
each time the learning community is taught.  

This formula applies only if there are a minimum of 15 students enrolled in the team-
taught section or learning community. If there are fewer than 15 students, the 
faculty may agree to negotiate the load, assuming that there is sufficient enrollment 
to offer the course. 
Faculty must make a proposal to the appropriate division chair(s); final approval will 
be granted by the Vice President for Academic Affairs. 
When minimum teaching load becomes an issue, division chairs have discretion in 
finding instructional alternatives for determining load. 
 
 
 
 
 

Compensation for Distance Learning 

Because technologies continue to change rapidly, opening new possibilities for using 
technology to enhance the teaching/learning process the American Federation of 
Teachers Local 1819 (the "Federation") and Community College District 513 (the

Course Enrollments 

Article IV, Paragraph A of the collective bargaining agreement between Illinois Valley 
Community College and the American Federation of Teachers Local 1810 sets forth 
certain student enrollment limits for courses. Because students often drop out of 
classes before or in their early stages of the term, the College and Union agree that 
the following procedures will not be considered a violation of this provision. 
Prior to the purge of non-paying students, the College may enroll up to two extra 
students over the stated limit in a course without consulting with and obtaining the 
approval of the instructor assigned to the course. If the number of extra enrollments 
remains two over the limit after the purge, approval of the instructor also will not be 
sought. After the purge, the College may enroll one extra student without instructor 
approval, but instructor approval will be obtained before any additional enrollments 
are accepted. 
If assigned instructors will be unavailable during the summer or fall for consultation 
about extra enrollments, they and their Division Chairs will discuss procedures to be 
followed for consultation on extra enrollments, such as the following: 

1.  Voice mail, which faculty will check regularly;  
2.  Telephone contact with the instructor at home;  
3.  Delegate decision to Division Chair, or;  
4.  Leave other instructions with Division Chair.  

During the summer or other vacation period when the faculty member is not on 
campus and/or is out of the area, the faculty member’s Division Chair may authorize 
overloads following the procedure as outlined above. In these cases, the Division 
Chair assumes responsibility to inform the faculty member of the action taken. 
In addition to verbal authorization from the Instructor or Division Chair, full-time 
faculty may authorize Admissions and Records personnel to permit additional 
enrollments (as specified in paragraph two) in any of the following manners: 

1.  Signing a student’s registration form, with an "O.K. to overload" 

notation;  

2.  Forwarding a handwritten note stating same;  
3.  Via an e-mail message, stating same, to the Director of 

Admissions/Records or the Registrar.  

4.  Via a phone call or voice message to the Director of Admission/Records 

or the Registrar.

Letter of Understanding: Clarification 
of Distance Learning Compensation 

Community College 513 (the "College") and the AFT Local 1810 (the "Union") agree 
to the following clarification of the language in Article XIII.F.1 of the 2000-2004 
Collective Bargaining Agreement regarding the definition of "web-enhanced course:" 
In addition to using basic web-based tools such as WebBoard, a web-enhanced 
course could incorporate the following, as examples: 

•  Changes in seat-time requirements.  

•  Group projects, research projects, or team assignments conducted via the 

Internet, using such tools as WebBoard.  

Any web-based or web-enhanced course should 

•  maintain the integrity of the course curriculum  

•  hold students to the same expected outcomes as if the course were delivered 

in a totally face-to-face format  

•  vary strategies for assessment of student learning to be consistent with the 
delivery methods employed; course syllabi and assessment grids should be 
revised to reflect changes in assessment strategies

Early Retirement Program 

This letter states the agreement reached between the Community College District 
No. 513 and the American Federation of Teachers, Local 1810. 
The administration and Local 1810 will work together to inform faculty about all 
aspects of IVCC’s early retirement program as set by Board policy, in order to 
maximize retirement benefits. This includes education on current administration 
procedures and existing practices as well as the implications of SURS policies. 
The following strategies have been agreed upon in order to ensure that faculty are 
fully informed: 

1.  An in-house workshop in which current administrative procedures, 

existing practices, and implications of SURS policies will be presented 
collaboratively by the Office of Human Resources and a union 
representative. These workshops will be held in the fall and spring 
semester each year.  

2.  A joint written communication will be sent by the Office of Human 

Resources and the President of Local 1810 to faculty who are eligible 
to apply for early retirement benefits. This communication will:  

a.  Request that HR be notified of the faculty 
member’s planned date of retirement as 
early as possible.  

b.  Stress that the purpose of this request is 

to maximize retirement benefits to the 
faculty member.  

3.  Both written communications and workshops will stress the 

confidential nature of the information exchange regarding SURS 
policies and their implications for benefits.

Salary Schedule Advancement: 
Approved Professional Development 
Plan 

Community College District 513 (the "College") and the American Federation of 
Teachers Local 1810 (the "Federation") agree to implement on a pilot basis an 
alternative method for advancement on the salary schedule as outlined below. The 
pilot program will be implemented for the first two years of this contract (FY2001 
and FY2002). 
Final approval of any professional development plan granted during the pilot period 
will be honored, and a faculty member will be allowed to complete his/her plan for 
movement to the column specified in the approved plan. While long-term plans may 
be given tentative approval, only plans that have received final approval during the 
pilot period will necessarily be honored. 
During the pilot period, the Educational Excellence Council (EEC) will evaluate the 
operation of the program, including evaluation of each professional development plan 
with input from the faculty members who submitted plans and the committee that 
evaluated them. The EEC shall have authority to make reasonable modifications in 
the program during the pilot period. At the conclusion of the pilot period, the parties 
agree to negotiate changes in this program, which may include modifications of the 
pilot program based on experience, to the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
