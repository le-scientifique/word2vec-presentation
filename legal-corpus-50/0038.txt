ASSOCIATION SECURITY 

 
 
 
 
 
MEMBERSHIP 
 
 
-49  As  a  condition  of  employment,  each  employee  in  the  bargaining  unit  on  or 
before  the  thirtieth (30th) day after the effective date of this Agreement, or on or 
before the thirtieth (30th) day after the completion of the probationary period in the 
bargaining  unit,  whichever  is  later,  and  monthly  thereafter,  shall  tender  to  the 
Association,  either  periodic and uniformly required Association dues as set forth in 
the bylaws of the Michigan State University Administrative Professional Supervisors 
Association, or in the alternative, service fees in the amount equal to these dues in 
accordance with MCLA 423.210 (2); MSA 17.455 (10). 
 
-50  Employees  covered  by  this  Agreement  at  the  time  it  becomes  effective  and 
who are members of the Association at that time shall be required as a condition of 
continued employment to continue membership in the Association for the duration of 
this Agreement. 
 
 
CHECK-OFF 
 
 
-51  The  Employer,  at  the  time  of  hire,  rehire,  reinstatement  or  transfer  of  an 
employee  into  the  bargaining  unit,  shall  apprise  the  prospective  member  of  these 
provisions  and  shall  present  to  him/her  an  application  for  membership  and  an 
authorization for checkoff of dues, such form to be provided by the Association. 
 
 

If the employee desires to join the APSA, the employee shall complete 
both the application for membership and authorization card for checkoff 
of dues and return them to the APSA financial officer. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

If the employee does not desire to join the APSA, the employee shall 
complete only the authorization card for checkoff of dues so that the 
APSA may collect from the employee its service fees equal to the dues 
and return it to the APSA financial officer. 

If the employee desires to tender dues or fee directly to the Association, 
the employee will so indicate on the authorization for dues form which  

-14- 

shall be transmitted to the Association on or before  the thirtieth (30th) 
day of employment with dues or fee equivalent to twelve (12) months 
dues or fees.  Adjustment of dues or fees shall be made at the end of 
twelve (12) months from these receipts.  Excess amounts then will be 
returned  to  the  employee  within  ten  (10)  days  of  demand  and 
insufficient  amounts  will  require  payment  within  ten  (10)  days  of 
notice.    Each  year  will  again  require  deposit  of  such  a  sum  and  the 
procedure indicated above will be applied. 

 
-52 
In  accordance  with  the  terms  and  authorization  for  checkoff  of  dues,  the 
Employer agrees to deduct membership dues or service fees levied from the pay of 
each employee who executes or has executed the authorization for checkoff of dues. 
 
-53  The initial deduction for any employee shall not begin unless the authorization 
for checkoff of dues and the certification of the APSA's financial officer as to the 
amount of the periodic Association dues or service fees have been delivered to the 
Employer's  payroll  department  at  least  fifteen  (15)  calendar  days  prior  to  the 
effective pay day. 
 
-54  All monies deducted by the Employer shall be remitted to the APSA financial 
officer once each month by the twentieth (20th) calendar day of the month following 
the month in which deductions were made together with a list of current employees 
showing  the  amount  of  Association  dues  or  service  fees  deducted  from  each 
employee. 
 
-55 
In  cases  where  a  deduction  was  made  which  duplicates  a  payment  already 
made to APSA by an employee, or where a deduction is not in conformity with the 
statutes made and provided, refunds to the employee shall be made by the APSA. 
 
-56  The Employer shall not be liable to APSA, by reason of Paragraph 52 of this 
Agreement, for the remittance or payment of any sum other than that constituting 
actual deduction made from the pay earned by the employee. 
 
-57  The  Employer  shall  not,  during  the  life  of  this  Agreement,  deduct  dues  or 
service fees from employees in this bargaining unit for any organization other than 
the Association without APSA's written permission. 
 
-58  APSA shall protect and save harmless the Employer from any and all claims, 
demands, suits, and other forms of liability by reason of action taken or not taken by 
the Employer for the purpose of complying with this Agreement.

TERMINATION FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY 
 
 
-59  An  employee  in  the  bargaining  unit  who  fails  to  tender  to  the  Association 
either periodic uniformly required Association dues, or in the alternative, service fees 
in the amount equal to these dues shall be terminated by the Employer, providing the 
following stipulations are adhered to: 
 
 

The Association shall notify the employee by certified or registered mail 
explaining  that  the  employee  is  delinquent  and  not  tendering  required 
Association  dues  or  service  fees,  specifying  the  current  amount  of 
delinquency,  and  warning  him/her  that,  unless  the  delinquent  dues  or 
service fees are paid within ten (10) working days of such notice, the 
employee shall be reported to the Office of Employee Relations with a 
request to terminate the employee provided for in this Agreement. 

If  either  the  dues  or  service  fees  are  not  paid,  the  Association  shall 
provide  a  copy  of  the  letter  sent  to  the  employee  and  the  following 
notice to the Office of Employee Relations at the end of the ten (10) 
day period: 

The  Association  certifies  that  ________________  has  failed  to  tender 
either  the  periodic  and  uniformly  required  Association  dues  or  service 
fees  required  as  a  condition  of  continued  employment  under  the 
Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  and  demands  that  the  employee  be 
terminated under the terms of this Agreement. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

The  employee  shall  be  terminated  by  the  Employer  within  thirty  (30) 
working days following receipt of the above letter and notice. 

 
 
TERMINATION OF LIMITATION 
 
 
-60 
If  an  employee  has  tendered  directly  to  the  Association  her/his  membership 
dues  or  the  service  fee,  or  has  a  written  authorization  in  effect  requiring  the 
deduction of dues or service fees, the employee shall not, under any circumstances, 
risk  the  loss  of  job  because  of  a  lack  of  good  standing  in  the  Association.    The 
Association cannot cause the discharge of an employee who has resigned from or 
who has been expelled by the Association for any reason other than his/her failure to 
tender the dues or service fees to the Association.

taken by the Employer for the purpose of complying with this Agreement. 
 
 
REVOCATION CARDS 
 
 
-62  The Employer will notify the Association monthly of the names of employees 
transferred outside the bargaining unit.  Such employees shall cease to be subject to

notice with the Association.  
 
 
AID TO OTHER LABOR ORGANIZATIONS

which purports to engage in collective bargaining or make any agreement with any 
such group or organization for the purpose of undermining the Association.

SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES 

 
 
 
 
 
EMPLOYEE RIGHTS 
 
 
-65  At any hearing, conference or meeting which may result in disciplinary action 
to  an  employee  in  the  bargaining  unit,  the  employee  may  and  is  encouraged  to

-66  An employee has the right to be informed prior to the investigatory interview 
of the subject matter of the interview.

representative. 
 
-68  The  parties  agree  that  any  individual  employee  at  any  time  may  present 
grievances to the Employer and have the grievances adjusted, without intervention of 
the Association, if the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Collective 
Bargaining Agreement now in effect, providing that the Association has been given 
the opportunity to be present at such adjustment. 
 
 
GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE 
 
 
-69  Grievances may be handled by Association representatives in the processing 
or hearing of any grievance not to exceed three (3) persons, excluding the aggrieved 
employee.  Representatives of the Association engaged in processing or hearing any 
grievance during regular scheduled working hours shall be paid for such time lost at 
the regular rate of pay, but in no event will more than three (3) representatives of 
the Association be paid for participation in any one session. 
 
-70  The Association Grievance Officer may represent the employee at all steps of 
the grievance procedure. 
 
-71  The  Association  Grievance  Officer  shall  be  allowed  time  off  without  loss  of 
pay, to investigate grievance(s) to be discussed or which have been discussed with  

 

 

-18- 

the Employer upon having received permission from his/her supervisor to do so.  The 
Association shall notify the Employer as to the name of its Grievance Officer. 
 
-72  An alternative Grievance Officer shall be designated by the Association to act 
in the absence of the Grievance Officer. 
 
-73  The Grievance Officer shall continue on the assigned duty during the term of 
office. 
 
 
TIME LIMITS 
 
 
-74  When reference to calendar days is made in this Article, holidays shall not be 
considered in these time periods.  Time limits set forth in this grievance procedure 
shall  be  strictly  adhered  to  unless  such  time  shall  be  extended  by  mutual  written 
agreement of the parties. 
 
 
WAIVER OF GRIEVANCE STEPS 
 
 
-75  Steps  of  the  grievance  procedure  may  be  waived  in  writing  by  mutual 
agreement of both parties.  The grievant may withdraw a grievance at any step of 
the procedure.  Grievances so withdrawn shall not be reinstated. 
 
If the Employer fails to schedule a meeting or answer the grievance within the 
-76 
designated  time  limits,  the  grievance  may  be  appealed  to  the  next  step  of  this 
grievance procedure within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the expiration of the 
applicable time limit. 
 
-77 
If  a  grievance  is  not  appealed  within  fourteen  (14)  calendar  days  after  (1) 
receipt of the previous step answer, (2) failure to schedule a meeting, or (3) failure to 
answer the grievance, the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of the 
Employer's last answer and not be subject to further review. 

 

 

-19- 

COMPUTATION OF BACK WAGES 
 
 
-78  No  claim  for  back  wages  shall  exceed  the  amount  of  salary  the  employee 
would  otherwise  have  earned  at  his/her  regular  rate,  including  offsets  for 
unemployment compensation, workers' compensation and any wages earned. 
 
 
REPRIMAND, SUSPENSION OR DISCHARGE 
 
 
-79 
In the event an employee is disciplined or discharged, copies shall be given to 
the employee and mailed to the Association at the time it is given to the employee 
and a copy placed in the employee's official personnel folder.  Such notice shall be 
specific  and  outline  the  reasons  for  the  disciplinary  action  or  discharge.    The 
Employer promotes a policy of progressive discipline; i.e., discipline shall gradually 
increase  depending  on  the  severity  and/or  frequency  of the infractions.  Normally, 
disciplinary action begins with a verbal warning for the first offense and culminates 
with discharge only after repeated attempts to correct the employee's behavior have 
failed.    Serious  infractions  may  warrant  the  immediate  imposition  of  a  written 
reprimand, suspension or discharge, as appropriate.   
 
-80  The  affected  employee  will  be  allowed  to  discuss  his/her  disciplinary  action 
with  an  Association  representative,  and  the  Employer  will  make  available  an  area 
where he/she may do so if he/she is required to leave the premises. 
 
In imposing any discipline on a current charge, the Employer will not take into 
-81 
account  any  prior  infractions  which  occurred  more  than  eighteen  (18)  months 
previously if there has been no further disciplinary action taken during that time.  
 
 
GRIEVANCES CONCERNING DISCIPLINE 
 
 
-82  Should the disciplinary action or discharge be considered without just cause, it 
shall  be  appealed  as  a  grievance  within  fourteen  (14)  calendar  days  after  written 
notification  of  the  discipline  is  received  by  the  affected  employee  and  the 
Association.    A  grievance  over  a  written  letter  of  reprimand  shall  be  submitted  at 
Step 2 of the grievance procedure; whereas, all other disciplines shall be submitted 
at  Step  3.    Failure  to  submit  a  written  grievance  within  the  time  limits  shall 
constitute a waiver of all claims concerning such disciplinary action or discharge.

STEP 1 
 
 
-88 
If the problem is not resolved, the grievance must be reduced to writing and 
presented to the immediate supervisor within fourteen (14) calendar days after its 
alleged occurrence in order to be a proper matter for the grievance procedure.  The 
grievance shall be dated and signed by the aggrieved employee and the Grievance 
Officer,  and  shall  set  forth  the  facts,  including  the  dates  and  provisions  of  this 
Agreement  that  are  alleged  to  have  been  violated,  and  the  remedy  desired.    The 
grievance shall not be considered submitted until the immediate supervisor receives 
the written grievance.  The immediate supervisor will schedule a meeting with the 
grievant and the Grievance Officer, if requested by the employee, within seven (7) 
calendar  days  from  the  day  the  written  grievance  was  received.    The  immediate 
supervisor will then answer the  grievance in writing within seven (7) calendar days 
from the meeting at which the grievance was discussed. 
 
 
STEP 2 
 
 
-89  Any  appeal  of  a  decision  rendered  by  the  immediate  supervisor  shall  be 
presented  in  writing  to  the  administrative  head  or  designee  within  fourteen  (14) 
calendar days of the receipt of the written decision of the immediate supervisor.  The 
appeal shall state the reason(s) why the decision of the immediate supervisor was 
not  satisfactory.    The  grievance  shall  not  be  considered  appealed  until  the 
administrative  head  or  designee  receives  it,  dates  it  and  returns  a  copy  to  the 
presenter.    The  administrative  head  or  designee  shall  schedule  a  meeting  within 
fourteen  (14)  calendar  days  with  the  grievant,  the  Grievance  Officer  if  requested, 
and  representatives  designated  by  the  Employer  to  discuss  the  grievance.    The 
administrative head or designee shall then give a decision in writing to the presenter 
within fourteen (14) calendar days of the meeting. 
 
 
STEP 3 
 
 
-90 
If the answer from the administrative head or designee is not satisfactory, the 
Association shall submit an appeal within fourteen (14) calendar days of the receipt 
of the Step 2 answer to the Director of Employee Relations or designee, indicating  

 

 

-22- 

the  reasons  why  the  written  answer  of  the  administrative  head  or  designee  was 
unsatisfactory.  The Office of Employee Relations will schedule a meeting between 
no  more  than  three  (3)  representatives  of  the  Association,  excluding  the  grievant, 
and  three  (3)  representatives  of  the  Employer  within seven (7) calendar days from 
the  date  the  appeal  is  received  to  discuss  the  grievance.    The  Office  of  Employee 
Relations  will  then  answer  the  grievance  in  writing  within  ten  (10)  calendar  days 
from the date of the meeting at which the grievance was discussed. 
 
 
ARBITRATION 
 
 
STEP 4 
 
 
If the Office of Employee Relations' answer is unacceptable, settlement may 
-91 
be determined by a decision of an arbitrator selected by the parties.  The Association 
will  notify  the  Office  of  Employee  Relations  within  twenty-one (21) calendar days 
after  the  receipt  of  the  Step  3  answer  if  the  Association  wishes  to  appeal  the 
grievance to arbitration, indicating why the Office of Employee Relations' answer is 
not satisfactory.  In the event the Association and the Office of Employee Relations 
do not agree on an arbitrator within seven (7) calendar days, the Association shall 
file the demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS) within seven (7) calendar days 
of failing to mutually agree on an arbitrator.  The fees and approved expenses of an 
arbitrator will be paid for by the parties equally.  The rules of the AAA or FMCS shall 
apply to all arbitration hearings.  The use of a court reporter will be permitted at the 
request of either party.  A copy of the transcript will be provided without cost to the 
party not requesting the court reporter. 
 
 
ARBITRATOR'S POWERS 
 
 
-92  The arbitrator shall have no power to add to or subtract from or modify any of

the  Employer  or  the  Association  where  such  discretion  has  been  retained  by  the 
Employer or the Association, nor shall he/she exercise any responsibility or function 
of the Employer or the Association.  Where either party challenges the jurisdiction of 
the arbitrator, the hearing will be held to determine whether the arbitrator does have 
jurisdiction before the hearing can be held on the merits. 
 

 

 

-23-

merit increase decisions and those matters provided for in provisions on probationary 
employees, and filling vacant positions. 
 
 
FINALITY OF DECISIONS 
 
 
-95  The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon the Association and its 
members, the employee or employees involved and the Employer, provided however, 
either  party  retains  all  legal  rights  to  challenge  arbitration  decisions  thereof  where 
such action is beyond the power of the arbitrator or where the award was procured 
by fraud, misconduct or unlawful means.

his/her  job  at  the  University  when  the  employee  is  not  satisfied  with  the 
determination  of  the  University's  physician,  he/she  may  submit  a  report  from  a 
medical doctor of his/her own choosing and at his/her own expense.  If  the dispute 
still  exists,  at  the  request  of  the  Association,  the  University's  physician  and  the 
employee's doctor shall agree upon a third medical doctor to submit a report to the 
Employer and the employee, and the decision of such third party will be binding on 
both parties.  The expenses of the report of the third party shall be shared equally by 
the Employer and the employee.

ARTICLE 8 

FLEXIBLE APPOINTMENTS 

 
 
 
 
 
DEFINITION 
 
 
-100  Flexible appointments are appointments of employees which provide between 
75%  and  92%  time  equivalent  salary  over  a  calendar  year,  with  some  benefit 
coverages  equivalent  to  full-time  appointments.    A  flexible  appointment  is  a 
voluntary commitment by an employee to a specific schedule of work. There are two 
types of flexible appointments: 
 
 

Type 1: 

Full-time active employment for nine (9), ten (10), or eleven (11) 
months  per  year  with  a  prescheduled  unpaid  leave  of  absence 
with  benefits  ("flex-leave")  during  the  remaining  month(s) 
(75%-92%  equivalent  employment  percent).    The  employee's 
position  is  held  for  his/her  return  at  the  end  of  the  flex-leave, 
unless  the  circumstances  of  the  University  change  and  the 
position no longer exists. 

 
 

Type 2: 

75%-89%  scheduled  time  active  employment  over  the  entire 
calendar year (30-35 hours per week) with a part-time equivalent 
salary. 

 
-101  As with any bargaining unit position, job demands may require work outside 
(overtime  pay  may  be  granted  in  accordance  with  the  overtime  provision)  and  in 
addition to those of the regularly scheduled flexible schedule. 
 
-102  Where  a  Type  1  flexible  appointment  includes  a  leave  with  benefits,  the 
employee's position is held for his/her return at the end of the flex-leave, subject to 
the conditions specified below. 
 
-103  The objective of flex-year appointments is to achieve budget flexibility where 
departmental  functions  can  be  accomplished  with  75%  employment,  through  a 
combination of benefits and other incentives. 
 
-104  Departments identify positions for flexible appointments.  Regular employees, 
and persons to be employed in those pre-identified positions, may agree to be placed 
in  flexible  appointments.    Employees  desiring  flexible  appointments,  but  whose 
positions are necessarily full-time may apply for transfers to flexible appointments,  

 

 

-26- 

subject to relevant policies.  When a department desires to change a position from 
full-time  to  a  flexible  appointment  and  the  incumbent  does  not  volunteer  for  that 
status, reduction in force procedures may be initiated to achieve the reduction within 
the  department.    If  a  flexible  appointment  position  is  subsequently  eliminated, 
reduction in force procedures will be initiated.  Employees with flexible appointments 
who  later  desire  a  change  in  appointment  may  apply  for  other  positions  as  they 
become available. 
 
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
 
FLEXIBLE POSITIONS 
 
 
-105  The  department  administrator  shall  identify  the  positions  appropriate  for 
flexible appointments, and, if specific duties are to be eliminated, indicate in writing 
the duties of such positions which are to be eliminated.  This designation must be 
approved by the Director of Human Resources, after receiving employee input. 
 
-106  Once a position is officially designated as flexible, only flexible appointments 
are acceptable. 
 
-107  A  flexible  position  shall  maintain  that  designation  until  the  departmental 
administrator acts to designate it otherwise by submitting the appropriate form for 
the approval of the Director of Human Resources. 
 
 
FLEXIBLE APPOINTMENTS 
 
 
-108  A  flexible  appointment,  either  as  an  initial  appointment  or  as  a  change  of 
appointment, may be granted only with the agreement of a prospective or current 
staff member.  Without agreement, a current staff member may be subject to the 
Reduction in Force policy. 
 
-109  A  flexible  appointment  must  be  arranged  in  advance  with an employee, and 
approved by the departmental administrator and the Director of Human Resources. 
 
-110  All flexible appointments will annually provide a minimum of 1,560 hours of 
scheduled work (subject to necessary reductions in force). 
 

 

 

-27- 

Type 1: 
Type 2: 

$1,000 x 9 months = $9,000 
$750 x 12 months = $9,000 

-111  A flexible appointee's FTE salary is the amount that would be paid if an entire 
year  was  worked  full-time  (e.g.,  $1,000/month  x  12  months  =  $12,000).    The 
base  salary  is  the  actual  expected  pay  during  the  year.    For  example,  if  the  FTE 
salary is $12,000, base salary at 75% would be: 
 
 
 
 
-112  Flexible appointees are regular employees. 
 
-113  Leaves with benefits may be established for periods of one (1) month or more, 
up to a maximum of three (3) months (in increments of one (1) month). 
 
-114  Leaves  with  benefits  are  only  those  that  are  prearranged  as  part  of  an 
approved flexible appointment. 
 
-115  No  Unemployment  Compensation  is  paid  during  a  leave  with  benefits.  
(Inasmuch as appointees on flex-leave have neither been laid off nor terminated but 
are  on  a  mutually  agreed  upon  leave  of  absence,  they  are  ineligible  for 
Unemployment  Compensation.    If  Unemployment  Compensation  is  sought  by  the 
employee,  the  leave  with  benefits  is  voided  and  the  employee shall be placed on 
layoff status, without application of reduction in force provisions). 
 
-116  If  the  flexible  appointment  converts  to  a  full-time status, the employee will 
receive an appropriate salary adjustment. 
 
-117  Employees volunteering for flex-leaves must sign the PAN form signifying the 
voluntary  concurrence  with  their  change  in  status.  This  action  is  subject  to  the 
review and approval of the Office of Human Resource Services. 
 
 
FRINGE BENEFITS 
 
 
-118  A flexible appointee's benefit eligibility during active flexible status and unpaid 
flex-leave is as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Receive the full University contribution toward health care coverage. 

Have  Long  Term  Disability,  Dental,  and  Expanded  Life  Coverage.  
(Subject to all current eligibility requirements.  Employees otherwise  

Benefits Programs.  Flexible appointees: 

 

 

-28- 

eligible for Long Term Disability continue their eligibility during the leave 
with benefits as well as active employment; however, benefit payments 
do not commence during the leave with benefits.  The base salary for 
the period of active employment prior to the flex-leave is used for the 
determination of benefits.) 

May  maintain  optional  employee-paid  life  and  accidental  death  and 
dismemberment coverage.  Prior to a flex-leave, advance deductions for 
applicable employee contributions for health, life and accident coverage 
are automatically taken to cover the flex-leave period.  In the event that 
insufficient notice of flex-leave is received, Benefits will bill employees 
for these amounts. 

 
-119  Educational Assistance is available, subject to all other eligibility requirements. 
 However,  Type  1  flexible  appointees  will  be  allowed  to  "bank"  educational 
assistance  for  use  during  non-work  flex-leave  periods  for  six  (6)  classes  up  to 
fourteen (14) credits per MSU academic year. 
 
-120  Personal  Leave  Days  will  be  credited  on  a  proportionate  basis,  i.e.:  
three-quarter (3/4) time service (either Type 1 or 2 Flex) will receive up to eighteen 
(18) hours in credits each year according to the Personal Leave Days schedule. 
 
-121  Full  service  credit  is  given  toward  retirement,  benefits  eligibility  waiting 
periods, and vacation service months. 
 
-122  Paid leave accruals are proportionate, and are accrued as follows: 
 
 

During active full-time service, the employee accrues leave as a 
full-time  employee.    During  a  flex-leave,  paid  leave  does  not 
accrue  and  may  not  be  utilized  (they  are  frozen  subject  to 
relevant policies). 

Type 1: 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

Type 2: 

During the entire calendar year, the employee accrues leave at a 
proportionate rate (unless additional leaves without pay are taken 
or the employee's status changes). 

 
-123  University  contribution  to  a  base  retirement  program  (which  includes 
TIAA-CREF  as  an  option)  and  Social  Security.    (Subject  to  all  current  eligibility 
requirements.) 
 
 

During active full-time service, the employee receives University 
contributions  based  on  his/her  full-time  salary.      No  University 
contributions  are  made  while  the  employee  is  on  a  leave  with 
benefits. 

Type 1: 

-29- 

 

Type 2: 

The  employee  receives  the  University  contributions  during  the 
entire year based upon his/her part-time equivalent salary. 

 
-124  All  salary-related  benefits  (paid  leave,  Employee-Paid  Life,  base  retirement 
program,  Long  Term  Disability,  Expanded  Life  Plan,  Extended  Disability,  and 
longevity) are based upon the flexible appointee's base salary.  The longevity cap will 
be that of full-time employees. 
 
 
PROBATIONARY PERIODS 
 
 
-125  Flex-leaves may begin during a probationary period; however, the time spent 
on the flex-leave will not count toward completion of the probationary period. 
 
 
OTHER EMPLOYMENT 
 
 
-126  Employees may work for other employers while on flex-leave. 
 
 
RETURN TO ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT 
 
 
-127  Employees  returning  from  a  flex-leave  are  assigned  to  their  previously  held 
positions, unless the circumstances of the University change to the extent that the 
position no longer exists.  Those affected by a reduction in force while on flex-leave 
are eligible for the provisions of the reduction in force policy.  Affected employees 
will be given written notice as soon as practicable, but no less than that stipulated in 
the reduction in force policy. 
 
 
SALARY PAYMENTS 
 
 
-128  Flexible  appointees  receive  their  base  salary  during  their  period  of  active 
service and no salary during flex-leave. 

 

 

-30- 

HOURS WORKED RECORDS 
 
 
-129  Departments  are  responsible  for  maintaining  record  of  hours  worked  for 
nonexempt employees with flexible appointments. 
 
 
POSITION MAINTENANCE 
 
 
-130  A position, held by an employee, which is changed to a flexible appointment, 
and  some  of  whose  duties  are  thereby  eliminated,  shall  not  be  downgraded  or 
eliminated as a direct result of the flexible appointment. 
 
 
EXPEDITED DISPUTES 
 
 
-131  Disagreements in the interpretation or application of the flexible appointment 
policy shall be subject to the grievance procedure and immediately proceed to Step 
3.  If the grievance is arbitrated, the expedited arbitration process shall be utilized. 
 
 
NOTICE REQUIREMENTS 
 
 
-132  At  the  time  of  presentation  of  a  voluntary  flexible  appointment  form  to  any 
employee, the employee shall be advised in writing: 
 
-133  If a Type 1 flexible appointment, the length of time of the unpaid leave, the 
time or times when said leave must be taken. 
 
-134  If  a  Type  2  flexible  appointment,  the  schedule  of  each  week  which  the 
employee shall be required to work. 
 
-135  In  addition,  each  employee  shall  receive  at  least  ten  (10)  working  days' 
written notice of the proposed flexible appointment before being required to respond. 
 An affected employee may consult with a representative of the Association prior to 
making a voluntary election to accept a flexible appointment. 

 

 

-31- 

ARTICLE 9 

REDUCTION IN FORCE 

 
 
 
 
 
-136  The  University  endeavors  to  provide  continuing  employment  for  employees.  
However, reductions in work force may be necessary due to lack of funds, lack of 
work, and/or other cause, not to undermine the Association.  Whenever practicable, 
the reductions should be made by restricting recruitment, transfers to vacant lateral 
or  lower  level  positions  where  the  employee  is  capable  of  performing  the  work 
and/or  normal  attrition,  but  if  deemed  necessary  by  the  University,  layoffs  will  be 
utilized. 
 
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
 
-137  Employees to be laid off shall be given a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days 
notice--a copy of which will be sent to the Association President--not to be offset by 
accrued vacation. 
 
-138  Within  a  unit,  probationary  employees  will  be  separated  before  non-
probationary employees are laid off, where it is determined that the non-probationary 
employees are able to perform the work within a ninety (90) day evaluation period. 
 
 

A.  Where ability to perform the work remaining is equal, the 
Employer will follow these priorities for reduction in force: 

 
 

 
 

 

 

1. 

2. 

Employees with unsatisfactory records before 
employees with satisfactory records. 

Employees  with 
employees with long service. 

short 

service  before 

 
-139  For purposes of layoff only, layoffs shall be within units identified below.

requirements for a vacant position and who is denied the ninety (90) day evaluation 
period  shall  receive  written  reasons  why  the  employee  was  not  selected  for  the 
evaluation period with a copy to the President of the Association.  An employee who 
does  not  successfully  complete  the  ninety  (90)  day  evaluation  period  shall  be 
returned to layoff status.  
 
-143  An employee on layoff status will lose all recall rights and be terminated upon

ARTICLE 10 

FILLING VACANT POSITIONS 

 
 
 
 
 
-151  The University agrees to the principle of career development of its employees 
and will, in good faith, encourage career concepts of employment. 
 
 
PROCEDURE 
 
 
-152  The  recruitment  of  applicants  and  the  filling  of  vacant  positions  is  the 
responsibility of the Employer.  All vacancies will be posted except those filled under 
bypass procedures extended to those individuals returning from leave of absence, on 
Long  Term  Disability,  Extended  Disability,  Workers'  Compensation  and  for  laid-off 
employees.    All  candidates  who  possess  the  posted  qualifications  shall  be 
considered.    The  Office  of  Human  Resource  Services  will  provide  employing 
departments with a list of the candidates.  If Employment determines an applicant to 
be not qualified for a posted position, the employee will be notified immediately.  In 
any instance where there are five (5) or more on-campus bargaining unit candidates 
possessing  the  posted  qualifications,  at  least  five  (5)  of  said  candidates  shall  be 
interviewed.  In the event fewer than five (5) bargaining unit candidates apply and 
possess the posted qualifications, each shall be interviewed.   
 
 
INTERVIEWS 
 
 
-153  The  responsibility  for  determining which candidates shall be interviewed will 
reside  with  the  employing  department.    This  determination  will  be  based  upon 
information obtained from the candidates' credentials.  The department should take 
longevity  of  service  into  account  when  determining  who  will  be  interviewed,  but 
ability to do the work shall be the prime factor for setting the interview list. 
 
-154  The Association shall be provided with a copy of the Position Vacancy Record 
which will contain the reasons for selection and non-selection.  This shall be done in 
a  timely  manner.    If  the  procedures  outlined  above  have  been  followed,  the 
determination will not be grievable.

ARTICLE 11 

CLASSIFICATION/RECLASSIFICATION OF POSITIONS 

 
 
 
 
 
-155  The  Employer  establishes  and  maintains  a  system  for  the  evaluation  and 
classification of all bargaining unit positions.  The authority to classify new positions, 
reclassify existing positions and eliminate positions is vested in the Office of Human 
Resource Services. 
 
 
NEW CLASSIFICATIONS AND RATES 
 
 
-156  When  a  classification  is  established  or  modified,  the  grade  level  for  the 
classification  shall  be  fixed  by  the  Employer  and  the  Association  shall  be  notified 
prior to implementation.  The compensation level shall be in conformity with rates 
established for positions of similar responsibility.  If there is a disagreement over the 
compensation assigned the position, a special conference may be scheduled with the 
Office of Employee Relations.  If the disagreement is not resolved, the Association 
may file  a demand for arbitration within fourteen (14) calendar days of the special 
conference.  The Arbitrator shall be limited to determining the appropriateness of the 
compensation  level  assigned  the  position  but  shall  be  without  power  to  assign  a 
compensation level for the classification. 
 
 
RECLASSIFICATIONS 
 
 
for  position 
-157  The  Unit  Administrator  will  normally 
reclassification.    However,  requests  may  be  initiated  by  the  Association.    Such 
requests  shall  be  directed  to  the  Assistant  Vice  President  for  Human  Resources 
whose  decision  on  the  request  shall  not  be  subject  to  review  or  grievance.  If  a 
request made under this paragraph is not approved, written reasons will be provided 
the Association.  An employee whose position is reclassified will not be required to 
serve either a new probationary period or trial period. 
 
 
SALARY RATE 
 
-158  The  salary  of  an  employee  whose  position  is  reclassified  to  a  higher  grade 
level shall be no less than the minimum salary of the higher grade level.

PROMOTION/DEMOTION 

 
 
 
 
 
PROMOTION 
 
 
-159  A "promotion" is defined as the movement of an employee to a higher grade 
level.    An  employee  promoted  one  grade  level  shall  receive  a  minimum  salary 
increase  of  five  (5%)  percent  or  placed  at  the  minimum  rate  for  the  new 
level--whichever  is  greater.    An  employee  promoted  two  (2)  or  more  grade  levels 
shall  receive  a  minimum  salary  increase  of  ten  (10%)  percent  or  placed  at  the 
minimum  rate  for  the  new  grade  level--whichever is greater.  The Employer is not 
prohibited  from  giving  APSA  employees  salary  increases  that  exceed  these 
minimums. 
 
 
DEMOTION 
 
 
-160  A "demotion" is defined as the movement of an employee to a lower grade 
level other than by reclassification.  The pay rate of an employee who is demoted 
will be reduced by five (5%) percent if the grade level is lowered one grade level and 
ten (10%) percent or more if the grade level is lowered two (2) or more grade levels. 
 The Employer may make exceptions to this provision when deemed appropriate.

PROBATIONARY PERIOD 
 
 
-161  Employees shall serve a twelve (12) month probationary period beginning at 
the time of hire as a new employee with the University or entry into the bargaining 
unit from other University employment.  The Unit employer-supervisor shall have the 
right to certify successful conclusion of the probationary period before the end of the 
twelve  (12)  months.    The  Association  President  shall  be  notified  upon  early 
certification. 
 
-162  An  interim  written  evaluation  shall  be  prepared  by  the  probationary 
employee's  supervisor,  summarizing  overall  job  performance,  which  shall  be 
reviewed  with  the  employee.    If  a  probationary  employee's  performance  is 
unsatisfactory,  such  fact  shall  be  communicated  to  the  employee  as  soon  as  is 
practicable  in  order  to  give  the  employee  the  opportunity,  if  possible,  to  improve 
his/her performance. 
 
-163  The  Association  shall  represent  probationary  employees  for  the  purposes  of 
collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and 
other conditions of employment; however, no matter concerning the discipline, layoff 
or  termination  of  a  probationary  employee  shall  be  subject  to  the  grievance  or 
arbitration procedures. 
 
 
WRITTEN EVALUATIONS 
 
 
-164  Employees  may  receive a performance evaluation prior to the completion of 
the probationary period and thereafter, at least on an annual basis. 
 
-165  The Employer and the Association agree that members of the bargaining unit 
shall be subject to an appraisal process that is fair. 
 
-166  The  Employer  and  the  Association  believe  that  appraisal  systems  for 
supervisors at Michigan State University should be bilateral and continuing in nature. 
 
-167  The objectives of the appraisal program are to: 
 

 

 

-49- 

Enhance  communications  between  an  employee  and  a 
supervisor.  Dialogue between an employee and supervisor 
should  be  continuous  and  include  coaching,  guiding,  and 
clarification of job responsibilities in the context of larger 
organizational goals. 

Develop employees.  An employee's development may be 
related to either current or future positions and should be 
continuous to ensure that the University is able to respond 
to its quickly-changing environment. 

 

 
 

 
 

A. 

B. 

C. 

Support  continuous  quality  improvement  throughout  the 
organization. 

 
 
REPRESENTATION 
 
 
-168  The  Association  shall  represent  probationary  employees  for  the  purposes  of 
collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and 
other conditions of employment; however, no matter concerning the discipline, layoff 
or  termination  of  a  probationary  employee  shall  be  subject  to  the  grievance  or 
arbitration procedures. 
 
 
TRIAL PERIOD 
 
 
-169  An employee who changes classification within the bargaining unit shall serve 
a six (6) month trial period, which trial period may be extended by the Employer for 
an  additional  six  (6)  months  upon  providing  to  the  employee  written  notice  with 
reasons, with copy to the Association not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to 
the completion of the original six (6) month trial period.  The determination to extend 
the six (6) month trial period for an additional six (6) months shall not be grievable. 
 
-170  In the event the trial period is unsatisfactory or the employee does not wish to 
continue in the position, every effort will be made to return the employee to a former 
grade level and comparable classification.

October 1, 2000. 
 
 
OVERTIME 
 
 
-204  Bargaining unit employees in grade levels APSA 8, 9, 10, and 11, will receive 
overtime payment or compensatory time off at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) 
for scheduled hours worked in excess of forty (40) in a work week.  Employees shall 
have the right to indicate their preference for pay or compensatory time for overtime 
worked.  If an employee wishes to receive compensatory time, the request must be 
approved by the Unit Administrator. 
 
-205  In health care delivery facilities where biweekly work schedules of eighty (80) 
hours are maintained, overtime pay or compensatory time off will be given for any 
scheduled hours worked in excess of eighty (80) hours in a biweekly period. 
 
-206  Paid  time  (vacation,  sick  leave,  holiday,  personal  leave,  compensatory  time, 
jury  duty,  military  leave  and  funeral  leave)  is  considered  as  time  worked  for  the 
purpose  of  overtime  computation.    Overtime  premium  shall  not  be  pyramided, 
compounded or paid twice for the same time worked. 
 
-207  Employees who are called upon to perform special services not usually a part 
of their regular duties and/or responsibilities and who perform these services outside 
of their normal work schedules will receive payment in accordance with policies of 
the Employer.  Unit Administrators or designees are responsible for the approval of 
overtime prior to the performance of overtime work.  Approval means time worked 
as directed by the employee's supervisor and does not include casual or unscheduled 
time spent at work beyond the normal work day or work week. 
 
-208  Employees  at  grade  level  APSA  12  and  above  are  not  eligible  for  overtime 
pay.    However,  where  unusual  staffing  and  work  requirements  exist,  the  Unit 
Administrator may approve compensatory time off equal to the number of overtime 
hours worked.*

LONGEVITY PAY 
 
 
-209  A longevity pay plan to recognize long term employment is provided after six 
(6) years of continuous service with the University to regular staff working half time 
or more. 
 
-210  The  longevity  year  is  the  twelve  (12)  month  period  beginning  October  1  of 
each year, and  ending September 30.   The last date of hire will be used as the 
longevity date.  The employee must be engaged in active employment for thirty-nine 
(39) calendar weeks (273 calendar days) and be on the payroll as of October 1 of 
the longevity year.  Six (6) years or more of continuous service as of October 1 of 
the longevity year is required for eligibility. 
 
-211  Eligible employees who have periods of inactive service totaling ninety-three 
(93) days or more during a longevity year will not receive a longevity payment that 
year and will have the longevity date adjusted for future years. 
 
-212  Military leave of absence will not adjust the longevity date. 
 
-213  Full-time Employees who terminate prior to October 1 who are sixty-five (65) 
years of age and have five (5) or more years of full-time service, or who meet the 
minimum  University  retirement  requirements  will  receive  a  prorated  longevity 
payment. 
 
-214  Employees who are not on the active payroll due to layoff, but who otherwise 
meet the eligibility criteria, will receive a longevity payment. 
 
-215  Employees who are on leave of absence on October 1, but otherwise meet the 
eligibility criteria, will receive a longevity payment upon return to work.  Payment is 
scheduled  annually  on  the  first  working  day  of  December  and  is  computed  as  a 
percentage  of  the  employee's  annual  base  rate  of  pay  as  of  September  1  of  the 
calendar year in which the longevity payment is made.  Base rate of pay shall not 
include overtime or premium pay. 
 
-216  If an employee is not on the payroll September 1, the rate to be used is the 
employee's  rate  of  pay  upon  his/her  return.    Longevity  pay  shall  not  exceed  the 
longevity pay schedule.

Each  employee  may  elect  single  person 
coverage  under  either  the  base  or  optional

waive  University  coverage  and  receive  the 
Six  Hundred  ($600.00)  Dollar  waiver  in 
accordance with existing provisions. 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

The  foregoing  options  remain  subject  to  otherwise 
applicable  conditions  and  limitations  regarding  eligibility 
and proportional benefits. 

 
-224  Employees  eligible  for  MSU  health  care  coverage  are  eligible  to  waive  the 
MSU  health  care  coverage  each  year  during  the  annual  health  care  plan  open 
enrollment  to  be  effective  July  1  through  June  30.    Employees  waiving  coverage 
receive up to a Six Hundred ($600.00) Dollar payment made in the month of July of 
the  next  plan  year.    Re-enrollment  into  the  MSU  health  care  plan  will  be  allowed 
during the year if proof of involuntary loss of other health care coverage is provided 
within thirty-one (31) days of loss of coverage.  The individual would no longer be 
eligible for the full lump-sum payment. 
 
-224  While the employee is on layoff, the Employer will make its normal premium 
contribution  toward  the  cost  of  the  health  plan  coverage  for  the  two  (2)  months 
beyond the month of separation due to layoff. 
 
-225  Co-pays and premium shares, if any, for members of the Association, shall not 
be more than those applicable to other University employee groups, represented and 
unrepresented. 
 
 
DENTAL PLAN 
 
 
-226  The University offers a choice of two dental plans:  fee for service (traditional

employees and official Michigan State University retirees. 
 

 

 

-70- 

-227  Dental coverage is for eligible employees, retirees, survivors of retirees, and 
eligible dependents.  The fee for service plan pays fifty (50%) percent of usual and 
customary charges for most dental services as defined in the Master Policy. 
 
-228  Full-time and part-time employees must enroll within sixty (60) days of initial 
employment or during a scheduled open enrollment.  Coverage terminates at the end 
of  the  month  employment  terminates  unless  the  employee  is  an  official  Michigan 
State  University  retiree.    This  benefit  continues  for  employees  on  layoff  or  on 
approved leave of absence. 
 
-229  Benefit payments on the fee for service plan are limited each calendar year to 
Six Hundred ($600.00) Dollars for  each person.  Orthodontic services are covered 
for persons under age nineteen (19) and are limited to a separate lifetime maximum 
of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00).  Under the current provisions, the University pays 
the entire cost of the plan for full-time employees, with a proportional contribution 
for part-time employees. 
 
-230  Coverage  for  the  DMO  must  be  provided  through  one  of  their  participating 
centers.   Some benefits, such as diagnostic, preventive and minor restorations are 
no cost to the employee and other benefits are provided with a fixed dollar copay.  
Orthodontic services are covered for under age nineteen (19) and over age nineteen 
(19) with a fixed dollar copay. 
 
-231  Dependent  coverage  terminates  as  above.    In  addition,  certain  changes  in 
dependent status will terminate coverage for dependents.  No conversion is possible 
for either of the dental plans. 
 
-232  The premium cost of the Dental HMO shall not be greater than the cost of the 
traditional Delta Dental Plan premium.

-315  To  receive  reimbursement  for  MSU  courses,  the  employee  shall  submit  the 
completed  Educational  Assistance  form  with  departmental  approval  to  Human 
Resource Development.  For the waiver to appear as a credit on the first billing by 
the  Office  of  Fees  and  Scholarships,  the  employee  must  submit  the  educational 
assistance form to Human Resource Development at least thirty (30) days prior to 
the date of the first billing.  Applications for educational assistance received after this

employee. 
 
-316  To  receive  reimbursement  for  non-MSU  courses,  the  employee  shall  submit

approved  course(s)  is/are  unavailable  at  the  time  of  registration,  other  appropriate 
course(s) may be substituted and the application amended subject to the approval of 
the  department  administrator  or  designee  and  the  Human  Resources  Development 
Office. 
 
-323  Employees  who  have  had  their  tuition  waived  will  authorize  the  Human

as may be collected for third parties. 
 
-336  The  course  fee  courtesy  will  be  granted  through  the  semester  in  which  the 
120th credit is attempted provided the dependent child, spouse or qualified same-sex 
domestic partner is registered as a student in good academic standing at Michigan 
State  University  in  a  curriculum  leading  to  the  first  baccalaureate  degree  or  to  a

which the combination of transferable credits and Michigan State University credits 
attempted equals 120.  The course fee courtesy is available only to students enrolled 
through the on-campus registration process. 
 
-337  The course fee courtesy for dependent children, spouses and qualified same-

The student must be enrolled in Agricultural Technology or 
a degree granting program leading  to a first baccalaureate 
degree (No Preference students are eligible). 

Credits  attempted  must  total  less  than  120.  Credits 
attempted  will  be  calculated  by  adding  to  the  student's

Michigan State University in accordance with the normal 
requirements for admission or readmission.

will receive the Course Fee Courtesy.  However, if other forms of financial aid have 
been awarded to attend Michigan State University, the aid will be adjusted to reflect 
the Course Fee Courtesy.  Depending on the types of awarded aid as well as when 
the Office of Financial Aids is informed of eligibility for the Course Fee Courtesy, the 
adjustment may be made to awarded grants, loan or work eligibility according to the 
guidelines of the Office of Financial Aid and the student shall be so informed. 
 
-344  Eligibility for other tuition-specific awards (such as the Michigan Competitive 
Scholarship,  Kodak  Scholarship  or  Engineering Cooperative Award) will reduce the 
Course  Fee  Courtesy  award  so  that  the  awards  in  combination  will  not  exceed 
assessed tuition. 
 
-345  If  the  student  drops  courses  or  withdraws  from  school  during  the  refund 
period,  any  refund  applicable  to  the  Course  Fee  Courtesy  will  revert  to  the 
University.

ARTICLE 23 

RETIREMENT BENEFITS 

 
 
 
 
 
-348  The  University  provides  a  contributory  retirement  program  for  regular  staff 
working  half-time  or  more.    The  benefit  provides  income  during  retirement  and 
benefit payments in the event of death prior to retirement.  Contributions from the 
employee  and  the  University  are  paid  into  an  individual  contract  between  the 
employee and the eligible vendor. 
 
-349  Employees meeting the minimum retirement requirements will remain eligible 
to  maintain  group  dental  and  health  plans  and  receive  the  Employer's  proportional 
contribution (see "FTE Service Months" language).  Retirees are required to enroll in 
both  Parts  A  and  B  of  Medicare,  and  pay  the  required  premium  when  eligible.  
University coverage will become supplemental to Medicare. 
 
 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
 
 
-350  Employee contributions are five (5%) percent and University contributions are 
ten (10%) percent of the employee's base salary or wage. 
 
-351  The  University's  contribution  is  made  on  a  tax-deferral  basis,  i.e.,  the 
employee does not report the University contribution as earned income when filing 
income tax returns for the calendar year.  After retirement, the employee does pay 
taxes on the amounts received. 
 
-352  An  additional  portion  of  the  employee's  salary  may  be  contributed  to  a 
Supplemental  Retirement  Plan  (SRP)  by  the  employee  on  a  tax-deferred  basis, 
through payroll deduction, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. 
 
-353  Regular  employees  are  eligible  for  participation  in  TIAA-CREF,  Fidelity 
Investments or Vanguard Group in accordance with the following policies: 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

1. 

The  program  is  optional  to  employees  at  the  time  of 
employment  or  who  are  over  age  sixty-two  (62)  at  the 
time of employment. 

2. 

The program is required as a condition of employment for 
employees who have attained the age of thirty-five (35). 

-91- 

 

3. 

Once required participation commences, it is not possible 
to  withdraw  from  the  University  retirement  programs 
while employed at the University. 

 
-354  Employees  have  a  cashability  option  as  described  in  the  Board  of  Trustees 
action of February 1, 1991.

ARTICLE 24 

WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND DISABILITY 

 
 
 
 
 
WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
 
 
-355  A regular full-time employee with ninety (90) days of continuous service who 
suffers injury compensable under the Workers' Compensation Act shall continue to 
receive his/her regular rate for time lost during the first seven (7) days not covered 
by the Workers' Compensation Act, provided he/she follows the instructions of the 
University  physician,  and  provided  he/she  returns  to  work  not  later  than  the  time 
recommended  by  the  University  physician.    In  the  event  of  dispute,  the  medical 
dispute  clause  of  this  Agreement  shall  apply  as  regards  the  settlement  of  such 
dispute.  Following the first seven (7) days, such seniority employee shall be paid the 
difference between his/her regular wages and payment received under provisions of 
the  Act,  to  be  deducted  from  accumulated  sick  leave  until  his/her  sick  leave  is 
exhausted. 
 
-356  Employees who have exhausted their sick leave credits, but are still unable to 
return to work, may as an option continue to receive their pay against any unused 
vacation and personal leave credits. 
 
 
WORKERS' COMPENSATION (LONG TERM) 
 
 
-357  An employee who is receiving regular Workers' Compensation for a period in 
excess of six (6) months shall receive, at the Employer's expense, Employee-paid life 
and health care coverage for the period covered by Workers' Compensation.  If it is 
determined  by  the  Benefits  Office  that  the  injured  employee  will  be  off  work  in 
excess  of  six  (6)  months,  the  above  benefit  may  be  implemented  upon  such 
determination without requiring premium payments from the affected employee. 
 
 
EXTENDED DISABILITY LEAVE 
 
 
-358  The University provides an interim income protection plan for regular full-time 
staff expected to receive long term disability benefits.  The benefit provides full pay 
as defined in the long term disability master contract, for a period of up to one 

 

 

-93- 

hundred eighty (180) days from the employee's last day of active work.  The benefit 
commences upon the expiration of all accrued sick, vacation, and personal leave. 
 
-359  Determination  of  whether  a  case  is  expected  to  result  in  total  disability  can 
sometimes  be  made  by  the  University  designated  physician  based  on  information 
received  from  the  employee's  physician  and  other  medical  reports.    A  lack  of 
conclusive medical evidence may delay approval of the extended disability leave  on 
a  retroactive  basis.    In  these  cases,  it  is  necessary  for  the  employee  to  maintain 
benefit payments.  Reimbursement will be made for University contribution amounts 
upon approval for Extended Disability Leave. 
 
-360  Employees expected to return to work within one hundred eighty (180) days 
will  not  qualify  for  this  benefit.    Authorization  to  pay  extended  disability  leave 
benefits will be made by the Benefits Office.  The University pays the cost of the 
benefit.  No application is necessary for enrollment.  The benefit becomes effective 
upon  completion  of  sixty  (60)  full-time  equivalent  service  months.    The  benefit 
terminates on the last day of employment.  Conversion of coverage is not possible. 
 
 
LONG TERM DISABILITY PLAN 
 
 
-361  The  University  provides  income  protection  through  the  long  term  disability 
plan for regular full-time staff. 
 
-362  The benefit is payable to employees who become totally disabled as defined in 
the LTD master contract and are unable to work due to sickness or bodily injury.  In 
addition, the University makes the regular contribution for health care coverage and 
pays the complete cost for dental and the employee-paid life plan. 
 
-363  The University pays the entire cost of the LTD benefit.  Coverage is automatic 
and  becomes  effective  the  first  day  of  the  month  following  or  coinciding  with 
completion of twelve (12) full-time equivalent service months.  Long term disability 
coverage will terminate on the employee's last day of active employment.
