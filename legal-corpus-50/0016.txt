General Provisions 
  
7.28  
  

Failure  of  the  grievant  to  comply  with  the  time  limitations  of  this  Article  shall  render  the 
grievance  null  and  void  and  bar  subsequent  filing  of  this  grievance.  Failure  by  the  appropriate

other remedies except as provided otherwise by statute. 
  
7.33

after considering the needs of the operation of the University.

7.40  
  

statements made and records used in grievance meetings shall be confidential. 
  
7.41  
  

An employee may present grievances and have such grievances adjusted without the intervention 
of the Union as long as adjustment is reached prior to Level V; provided such adjustment is not inconsistent 
with  the  terms  of  a  written  agreement  then  in  effect;  and  provided  that  the  CSU  will  not  agree  to  a 
resolution  of  the  grievance  until  the  Union  has  received  a  copy  of  the  grievance  and  the  proposed 
resolution, and has been given the opportunity to file a response. 
  
7.42  
 

The procedure (Article 7, Grievance Procedure, or Article 8, Complaint Procedure) utilized by the 
employee at the Level III filing shall indicate a final and binding selection of procedures. Prior to the Level 
III  filing,  the  employee  may  convert  to  the  alternative  procedure  without  interruption  of  time  limits  nor 
sequence of levels. If both a grievance and a complaint are filed at Level III on the same issue, either the 
grievance  or  the  complaint  shall  be  withdrawn  prior  to  the  Level  III  hearing.  (This  language  is  for 
clarification purposes only.) 
  

Except  as  provided  for  in  the  paragraph  above,  an  employee  may  not  utilize  both  Article  7,

employed at a campus. The President may appoint outside applicants when he/she determines such action is 
necessary to: (1) attain the affirmative action goals and objectives of the campus; (2) meet the best interest 
of the campus by  obtaining specialized skills and abilities not available from current employees.

For employees serving in ten (10) month positions, a year of service is the equivalent of ten (10) 
months  of  full-time  employment  within  a  twelve  (12)  month  period  of  time.  The  ten  (10)  months  of 
required service for each twelve (12) month period shall be determined by the President upon appointment

a.  When a probationary employee goes on a leave of absence, the President shall determine whether 
or  not  the  time  served  before  the  leave  is  counted  in  determining  the  remaining  length  of 
probationary service. 

 
b.  An employee's probationary period is extended for the same number of days such employee is on 
WC,  IDL,  NDI,  formal  LWOP  or  paid  sick  leave  of  over  thirty  (30)  days.  The President shall 
determine if there has been a break in service when a full-time probationary employee is placed on 
a partial leave of absence. 

c.  Normally, a new probationary period shall be served when an employee begins an appointment at 
another campus. However, the employee may be appointed with permanent status or credit toward 
permanency as determined by the President of the campus to which the employee is appointed. 

 

  
 Change in Position

probationary period shall be determined by the President and shall not exceed one (1) year.  

 
b.  A permanent employee in a position that is reclassified as a result of the implementation of a new 
classification  or  the  revision  of  a  current  classification  shall  not  be  required  to  serve  a  new 
probationary  period,  provided  the  employee  has  completed  probation  in  his/her  current 
classification and there has been no substantial change in the employee's duties.  

c.  A probationary employee in a position that is reclassified as a result of the implementation of a 
new classification or the revision of a current classification shall have all probationary service in 
his/her prior classification credited toward probation in the new or revised classification, provided 
there has been no substantial change in the employee's duties. 

  

 

  
 9.19  
  

If an employee with permanent status in a lower classification or skill level is advanced to a higher 
classification or skill level and is denied permanent status in the higher classification or skill level, he/she 
shall have the right to return to the lower classification or skill level with permanent status in that class. 
  

If  an  employee  in  a  probationary  status  in  a  lower  classification or skill level is advanced to a 
higher classification or skill level and is denied permanent status in the higher classification or skill level, 
he/she  shall  be  granted  service  credit  toward  completion  of  the  probationary  period  in  the  lower 
classification  or  skill  level  provided  the  duties  in  the  higher  classification  or  skill  level  are  substantially 
similar  to  the  duties  in  the  lower  classification  or  skill  level  and  the  employee's  performance  in  both 
classifications or skill levels has been satisfactory. 
  
 Classification Change 
  
 9.20  
  

When  an  employee  moves  to  a  lower  classification  in  the  same  occupational  group,  the 
appropriate  salary  rate  in  the  salary  range  shall  be  determined  by  combining  any  previous  service  in  the 
lower class and service in the higher classification. 
  
 9.21  
  

When an employee moves to a lower classification in another occupational group, the appropriate 
salary rate in the salary range shall be determined by the President, except that in no case shall the new rate 
exceed  the  rate  received  in  the  higher  classification.  Determination  of  the  appropriate  salary  rate  in  such 
cases  shall  be  made  by  using  the  same  criteria  as  would  be  used  for  an  initial  appointment  to  that 
classification. 
  
 9.22  
  
      When an employee moves without a break in service to a classification with a higher salary range, the 
appropriate salary rate in the salary range shall be determined by the President. The salary rate in the higher 
salary  range  shall  be  at  least  a  five  (5)  percent  increase.  This  provision  does  not  apply  to  the 
implementation  of  a  new  classification  structure  when  the  original  classifications  are  abolished  and 
replaced with a new set of classifications and the employees are converted to the new classifications.

Within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the reprimand, an employee may request a conference 
with the appropriate administrator who issued the reprimand to discuss the reprimand. Such a request shall 
not be unreasonably denied. The  employee may be represented at such a conference by another employee 
or a Union Representative.  
  
 12.3  
  

A  written  reprimand  shall  be  placed  in  the  official  personnel  file  of  the  affected  employee  and 
shall  be  subject  to  Article  11,  Personnel  File.  The  employee shall be provided with a copy of a written 
reprimand. An employee may appeal the decision to place a written reprimand in his/her personnel file to 
the President within five (5) days after the conference held pursuant to 12.2 above. The President may hold 
a  meeting  with  the  employee  and  his/her  representative,  if  any.  Within  ten  (10)  days  of  receipt  of  the 
appeal, the President shall provide a written response to the employee. 
  
 Rebuttal to Reprimand 
  
 12.4  

Upon  the  employee's  request  and  three  (3)  years  from  its  effective  date,  a  reprimand  in  the 
personnel  file  shall  be  permanently  removed.  Such  a  request  shall  be  promptly  honored  and  a  statement 
verifying the permanent removal of the reprimand shall be provided to the employee. 

Neither the employee request for such a removal, nor the statement verifying the removal, shall be 
placed in the employee's personnel file. If a notice of disciplinary action has been served on the employee 
and such a reprimand is related to the disciplinary action, this provision shall not be implemented. Nothing 
in this provision shall prohibit earlier removal of the reprimand. 
  
 Temporary Suspension 
  
 12.6  
  

The President may temporarily suspend with pay an employee for reasons related to (a) the safety 
of  persons  or  property,  (b)  the  prevention  of  the  disruption  of  programs  and/or  operation,  or  (c) 
investigation for formal notice of disciplinary action.

temporary suspension shall automatically terminate upon the service of formal notice of disciplinary action 
or thirty (30) days after its commencement, whichever first occurs. 
  
 12.10  
  

Temporary  suspension  and  corrective  action  shall  not  be  subject  to  Article  7,  Grievance 
Procedure, unless the grievant alleges the terms of this Agreement have been violated, misinterpreted, or 
misapplied. 
  
 Investigatory Interviews 
  
 12.11  
  

Upon  his/her  request,  an  employee  may  be  represented  at  an  investigatory  interview  if  he/she 
reasonably believes that disciplinary action may result. Prior to the interview, the employee is entitled to be 
informed of the general nature of the matter being investigated and to consult with his/her representative, if 
any.  The  right  to  representation  does  not  apply  to  meetings  held  exclusively  to  inform  an  employee  of  a 
previously  made  disciplinary  decision.  If  the  representative  an  employee  requests  is  unavailable,  the 
employee may request alternate representation. The Employer is not obliged to postpone the interview, nor 
to suggest or secure the alternate representation; however, the employee shall not be required to answer any 

questions without a representative present, unless he/she voluntarily chooses to do so. At its discretion, the 
Employer may decline to hold any interview if the employee requests representation.

 Automatic Resignation 
  
 13.1  
  
      An employee who is absent for five (5) consecutive workdays without securing authorized leave from 
the President shall be considered to have automatically resigned from CSU employment as of the last day 
worked.  All  unauthorized  absences,  whether  voluntary  or  involuntary,  shall  apply  to  the  five  (5) 
consecutive workday limitation. The five (5) day period referred to above shall commence at the beginning 
of the first shift of such absence and shall be deemed to have been completed at the end of the employee's 
scheduled work hours on the fifth (5th) consecutive day of unauthorized absence. 
  
 13.2  
  

The  President  shall  notify  the  employee  that  the  University  will  be  separating  him/her  by 
automatic resignation under this  Article unless the employee requests an administrative review regarding 
his/her absence within seven (7) calendar days following such notification. No automatic resignation shall 
be final until the seven (7) day period has passed and either a decision is made by the reviewing officer or 
the  employee  has  failed  to  request  a  review.  Notification  may  be  in  person  or  by  certified  mail  to  the 
employee's last known address.

review  within  seven  (7)  calendar  days  of  such  notification,  the  employee  will  be  provided  with  the 
opportunity  to  respond,  either  orally  or  in  writing,  to  a  campus  reviewing  officer  designated  by  the 
President.  Either  party  may  present  evidence  at  any  review  meeting.  The  reviewing  officer's  decision, 
which shall be rendered within fourteen (14) days of the administrative review, shall state: 
  

a.  whether the employee was absent for five (5) consecutive workdays; 

b.  whether the employee had proper authorized leave to be absent; 

c.  an evaluation of whether the employee has presented sufficient excuse to warrant continuation of 
employment,  supported  by  facts  which  provide  justification  of  the  absence  or  continuation  of 
employment. If an action other than automatic resignation is proposed, it shall be stated along with 
reasons for its use; and 

 

 

 

  
 13.4  
  

d.  whether the employee should be separated by automatic resignation. 

Any employee who is reinstated by the President under this provision shall not be paid salary for 
the period of unauthorized absence unless it is determined that such absence may be appropriately charged 
to accrued leave. The employee shall adhere to all other reinstatement requirements set forth in writing by 
the President.

For purposes of computing vacation credit, an employee who works eleven (11) or more days in a 
monthly  pay  period  is  considered  to have completed a month, a month of service, or continuous service. 
When  an  absence  without  pay  of  more  than  eleven  (11)  consecutive  working  days  falls  into  two  (2) 
consecutive qualifying monthly pay periods, one (1) of the pay periods is disqualified. 
  
 14.5  
  

An  authorized  leave  of  absence  without  pay  shall  not  be  considered  service  for  the  purpose  of 

Vacation  credits  are  cumulative  to  a  maximum  of  two  hundred  and  seventy-two (272) working 
hours for ten (10) or less years of qualifying service or three hundred and eighty-four (384) working hours 
for more than ten (10) years of such service. Accumulation in excess of this amount as of January 1 of each 
year shall be forfeited by the employee. An employee shall be permitted to carryover more than allowable 
credits  when  the  employee  was  prevented  from  taking  enough  vacation  to  reduce  the  credits  because  the 
employee (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extreme emergency; (2) was assigned 
work  of  priority  or  critical  nature  over  an  extended  period  of  time;  (3)  was  absent  on  full  salary  for 
compensable  injury;  or  (4)  was  prevented  from  using  vacation  previously  scheduled  to  be  taken  in

 Vacation Requests 
  
 14.8  
  

Requests for scheduling vacation shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate administrator at 
least thirty (30) days in advance. When authorized to do so by the appropriate administrator, an employee 
may take vacation without submitting such a request. If an employee submits a vacation request for five (5) 
days  or  less  with  less  than  thirty  (30)  days  notice,  such  request  will  be  approved  subject to operational 
needs. The appropriate administrator shall respond in writing to an employee's vacation request as soon as 
possible.  Once  approved  in  writing,  vacations  shall  not  be  rescinded  without  the  mutual  consent  of  the 
employee and the appropriate administrator, except in cases of emergency as determined by the appropriate 
administrator. 
  

Based  upon  the  operational  needs  of  the  campus,  vacation  schedules  shall  be  determined  by  the 
appropriate  administrator.  Vacations  shall  be  scheduled  and  taken  only  as  authorized  by  the  appropriate 
administrator. If a conflict in vacation requests arises, the appropriate administrator shall give consideration 
to the employee(s) with the most seniority, provided that operational needs are met. 
  
 Lump Sum Payment 
  
 14.9  
  

Upon separation from service without fault on his/her part, an employee is entitled to a lump sum 
payment as of the time of separation for any unused or accumulated vacation. Such sum shall be computed 
by projecting the accumulated time on a  calendar basis so that the lump sum will equal the amount which 
the employee would have been paid had he/she taken the time off, but not separated from service.

scheduled to work on the day the holiday is observed.  
  

If an employee is on a compressed work schedule and the holiday is observed on a non-workday, 
the employee shall be entitled to the number of holiday hours equal to their normal workday. This holiday 
must be used within thirty (30) days after the holiday was observed. An employee on a leave of absence 
without pay or in other non-pay status on a day a holiday is officially observed shall not be entitled to the

during the closure. Employees eligible for CTO may use accrued CTO during periods of campus closure. 
  
 14.17  
  

Should  an  employee  not  have  vacation  accrued,  sufficient  CTO  balance  or  Personal  Holiday  to 
cover the scheduled days of closure, he/she shall be provided sufficient work prior to the scheduled closure 
to prevent any loss of pay or benefits. Such time worked shall be in accordance with Article 19, Overtime.

Employees  who  are  in  an  academic  year  appointment  are  entitled  to  all  days  designated  in  the 
campus academic calendar as academic holidays, or any other day designated by the Governor for a public 
fast or holiday. If the timebase is less than full-time, this provision will be applied on a pro rata basis. 
  
 Personal Holiday 
  
 14.19  
  

An employee is entitled to one (1) Personal Holiday which must be taken on one (1) day during 
the calendar year. If the employee fails to take the Personal Holiday before the end of the year, the holiday 
shall  be  forfeited.  The  scheduling  of  the  holiday  shall  be  by  mutual  agreement  of  the  employee  and  the 
appropriate administrator. 
  
 Holiday Work Compensation

full-time  employees.  Employees  not  eligible for overtime as listed in Appendix C shall receive time off 
earned at the straight time rate.

on the day the holiday is observed, but is required to work on the calendar date of such a holiday, he/she 
shall only receive holiday work compensation for time worked on the calendar date of the holiday. Such 
compensation shall be provided pursuant to Provision 14.20, Holiday Work Compensation, of this Article.

CSU shall be paid the normal salary for the corresponding period of absence. No portion of the employee's 
salary shall be forfeited as the result of such an appearance; however, all court fees (except personal travel 
and/or subsistence payments) shall be remitted to the CSU. If an exceptional circumstance occurs whereby 
the employee does not remit such fees, an amount equal to the fees shall be deducted from the employee's 
salary. No vacation or compensatory time off (CTO) shall be used in such cases. 
  
 15.26  
  

An employee who receives court fees in excess of regular earnings may keep the excess and need 
remit only an amount equal to the compensation paid the employee while on leave. If the employee chooses

continuous with an employee's regular work schedule shall be compensated pursuant to the call-back pay 
requirements of Provisions 19.17 and 19.18 of this Agreement only if he/she is required to appear in court 
as a result of the exercise of his/her duties during working hours. 

Call-back pay under this provision shall not be provided to employees who are parties to a suit,

IDL  payments  with  charges  to  his/her  accrued  sick  leave.  Such  an  election  shall  be  made  no  later  than 
fifteen (15) days after the report of the injury for which the IDL is being paid. 
  
 15.32  
  

Such  supplement  shall  continue  until  the  employee  has  exhausted  his/her  accrued  sick  leave  or 
until  the  employee  provides to the CSU written notification he/she wishes to discontinue the supplement. 
Such a notice shall be provided fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of such a discontinuation.

Absence With Pay. 
  
 16.2  
  

A  written  application  for  a leave of absence without pay or an extension of a leave of absence 
without  pay  shall  be  submitted  to  the  President.  The  President  shall  determine  if  such  a  leave  shall  be 
granted and the conditions of such a leave, and shall respond to the application within forty-five (45) days. 

  
 16.3  
  

  
 16.5  
  

An employee who is on a leave of absence without pay shall not return to active pay status prior to 

the expiration of such a leave without written approval of the President. 
  
 16.4  
  

Service credit shall not be granted to an employee on a leave of absence without pay. 

A leave so granted assures to the employee a right to return to his/her former position or a position 
within his/her classification upon expiration of the leave and the time lost shall not constitute a break in 
service. 
  
 16.6  
  

When  requested  by  the  President,  an  employee  granted  a  leave  of  absence  without  pay  shall 

provide verification that the conditions of the leave were met. 
  
 16.7  
  

An employee on a leave of absence without pay for more than thirty (30) days may opt to continue 
his/her fringe benefits at his/her own expense. Upon written request of an eligible employee as defined in 
Article  21,  Benefits,  the  CSU  shall  provide  a  system  for  the  continued  payment  of  his/her  insurance 
premiums  including  health,  dental  and  vision  benefits  during  the  period  of  an  unpaid  leave  of  absence. 
During this period, such an employee shall pay both the employee's and the CSU's contributions. The CSU 
shall  not  advance  such  payments.  Such  an  employee  shall  pay  all  contributions  prior  to  the  date  each 
payment is due. Failure to pay such premiums will result in coverages lapsing unless the employee makes 
other arrangements. 
  
 16.8  
  

The granting or denial of leaves of absence without pay pursuant to Provisions 16.1 through 16.7 

shall not be subject to Article 7, Grievance Procedure.

medical leave without pay. 
  
 16.10  
  

An  employee  who  has  at  least  twelve  (12)  months  of  service  is  entitled  to  a  family  care  and 

Eligible employees may take up to a total of twelve (12) weeks of family care and medical leave in 

a 12-month period, including any periods of absence with pay for family care and medical leave purposes. 
  
 16.11  
  
       
An  employee  may  be  granted  family  care  and  medical  leave  for  the  birth  of  a  child  of  the 
employee, the placement of a child with an employee in connection with the adoption or foster care of the 
child  by  the  employee,  to  care  for  a  child,  parent  or  spouse  of  the  employee  who  has  a  serious  health 
condition, or for the employee's own serious health condition. 
  

 16.12  

The period of family care and medical leave granted to an employee for the birth of a child shall 

  
       
For family care and medical leave taken for reason of the birth of a child or adoption/foster care of 
a  child  by  an  employee,  any  leave  taken  shall  be  initiated  within  one (1) year of the birth of a child or 
placement of a child with the employee in the case of adoption/foster care. 
  
       
run concurrently with the period of leave available to an employee under Education Code Section 89519. 
  
 16.13  
  
       
The  amount  of  family  care  and  medical  leave  that  may  otherwise  be  granted  under  this  Article 
may  be  reduced  by  the  amount  of  family  care  and  medical  leave  granted  to  an employee for reasons set 
forth under Provisions 16.9 through 16.22. 
  
 16.14  
  
       
Before granting a family care and medical leave for the serious health condition of a child, parent 
or  spouse,  the  President  may  require  certification  of  the  serious  health  condition  from  the  health  care 
provider. 
  
 16.15  
  
       
Upon  expiration  of  the  period  which  the  health  care  provider  originally  estimated  that  the 
employee needed to care for the child, parent or spouse, the President may require the employee to obtain 
recertification if additional leave is requested. 
  
 16.16  
  
       
Family care and medical leave shall be leave without pay except that an employee must utilize all 
accrued personal holidays, vacation and CTO that he/she is otherwise eligible to take during the otherwise 
unpaid period of the family leave. 
  
 16.17  
  
An employee may use accrued sick leave during the period of family care and medical leave upon 
       
mutual  agreement  between  the  employee  and  the  appropriate  administrator.  Such  requests for sick leave 
shall be made in accordance with Article 15 of this Agreement. 
  
 16.18  
  

Family care and medical leave is separate and distinct from the right of a female employee to take 
a  pregnancy  disability  leave  under  Government  Code  Section  12945,  subdivision  (b)(2).  If  a  female 
employee takes part or all of the maximum four (4) months of pregnancy disability leave, she may request 
up to twelve (12) weeks additional family care and medical leave for reason of the birth of her child, or due 
to  her own serious medical condition. Family care and medical leave and pregnancy disability leave shall 
run concurrently with the period of leave available under the provisions of Education Code Section 89519. 
Family  care  and  medical  leave  shall  not  run  concurrently  with  pregnancy  disability  leave  under 
Government Code Section 12945. 
  
 16.19  
  

An  employee  shall  provide  the  President  with  written  notice  of  the  need  for  family  care  and 
medical leave as soon as the event necessitating the leave becomes known to  the employee. In general, as 
much advance notice as is reasonably possible shall be provided and normally shall not be less than five (5) 
working days of the event giving rise to the need for leave. 

  
 16.20  
  
       
If the employee's need for family care and medical leave is foreseeable due to the planned medical 
treatment or planned supervision of a child, parent or spouse with a serious health condition, the employee 
shall  provide  the  President  with  not  less  than  fourteen  (14)  days  notice  of  the  need  for  the  leave.  The 
employee  shall  consult  with  the  appropriate  administrator  regarding  the  scheduling  of  the  treatment  or 
supervision so as to minimize disruption of the operations of the campus. 
  
 16.21  
  
       
A  family  care  and  medical  leave  so  granted  assures to the employee a right to return to his/her 
former  position  or  an  equivalent  position  upon  expiration  of  the  family  care  and  medical  leave.  If  the 
former position and any equivalent position has ceased to exist due to legitimate business reasons unrelated 
to  the  leave,  the  campus  shall  make  reasonable  accommodation  by  alternative  means  that  will  not  cause 
undue  hardship  to  the  campus.  Such  alternative  means  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  offering  the 
employee  any  other  position  which  is  available and for which the employee is qualified. The family care 
and  medical  leave  shall  not  constitute  a  break  in  service  for  the  purposes  of  length  of  service  and/or 
seniority under this Agreement. 
  
 16.22  
  
An employee on family care and medical  leave shall retain employee status and shall continue to 
       
accrue seniority points pursuant to Article 24 of this Agreement during the period of the family care and 
medical leave. During a family care and medical leave, an employee may continue to participate in benefits 
to the same extent and under the same conditions as would apply to any other personal leave of absence 
without pay pursuant to this Agreement, except that if any paid portion of the family care and medical leave 
is less than twelve (12) weeks, unless canceled by the employee, the CSU shall continue to make employer 
contributions toward health, dental and vision coverage for the unpaid remainder of the twelve (12) week 
period. If an employee fails to return at the end of the family care or medical leave, the CSU may require 
repayment of insurance premiums paid during the unpaid portion of the leave. The CSU shall not require 
repayment of premiums if the employee's failure to return is due to his/her serious health condition or due 
to circumstances beyond the employee's control. 
  
 16.23  
  

The leave of absence of a temporary employee eligible for such leave pursuant to this Article shall 

terminate upon the expiration of that employee's temporary appointment. 
  
 16.24  
  

The granting or denial of leaves of absence without pay pursuant to Provisions 16.9 through 16.23 

shall be subject to Article 8, Complaint Procedure.

may  temporarily  effect  an  in-class progression for the performance of duties at a higher skill level in the 
same or a different position. Such a temporary assignment or temporary in-class progression may be for up 
to six (6) months, and shall be consistent with this Article  and/or Article 22, Professional Development. 
Such an assignment may be extended beyond six (6) months, but for not longer than another twelve (12) 
months,  by  mutual  agreement  of  the  President  and  the  employee.  An  employee  shall  be  provided  with 
written  notice  of  such  a  temporary  assignment  of  duties  of  another  classification  or  temporary  in-class 
progression at least seven (7) days prior to the effective date.  
  
 17.3  
  

An  employee  shall  begin  to  receive  the  appropriate  compensation  of  the  higher  classification or

description within one week of the employee's initial hire. After initial hire, upon the employee's request, 
the appropriate administrator shall provide the employee with a copy of the employee's position description 
if a current one is available. If a current one is not available, then the employee shall be provided with a 
copy  of  his/her  position  description  within  forty-five (45) days of his/her request. A copy of the position 
description signed by the employee shall be placed in the employee's official personnel file.

develop new classifications  or to revise current classifications. The CSU shall respond in writing to such 
request(s). 
  

The CSU shall notify the Union of the establishment of any new bargaining unit classification(s).  
The Union may, within 30 days of such notification, request the  University meet and confer on the impact

a.  A  Merit  Salary  Increase  (MSI)  is  movement  within  a  salary  range  based  upon  an 
overall  annual  job  performance rating of satisfactory, its equivalent, or better. An 
overall  rating  is  a  comprehensive  rating  based  on  a  review  of  all  performance 
categories 

b.  Employees with an overall rating below satisfactory, or its equivalent, or less than 
twelve (12) months of campus service as of July 1, 2000, shall not be eligible. An 

  

  

  

  

 

  

MSI shall be based upon the fiscal year 1999/2000 performance evaluation or the 
most recent annual performance evaluation in accordance with campus policy. 

c.  Each  employee  shall  receive  a  performance evaluation in accordance with Article 
10, Employee Performance. This procedure does not require campuses to modify 
existing performance evaluation forms unless existing forms do not have an overall 
rating. In such cases an overall rating must be determined and added or attached to 
the  performance  evaluation  form.  Existing  annual  performance  evaluations  and 
overall  ratings  contained  in  the  official  personnel  file  shall  remain  unchanged 
except  with  the  addition  of  an  overall  rating  where  none  exists. No employeesâ€™ 
overall  performance  rating  shall  be  changed  after  it  has  been  presented  to  the 
employee for signature. 

d.  An  employee  whose  performance  has  been  rated  overall  as  satisfactory,  or  its 
equivalent,  shall  receive  a  1.2%  (one  and  two-tenths  percent)  increase.  An 
employee  whose  performance  has  been  rated  overall  as  above  satisfactory  shall 
receive  an  increase  in  excess  of  1.2%  (one  and  two-tenths percent). The percent 
increase  shall  be  determined  by  the  President,  the  Presidentâ€™s  designee  or  other 
appropriate administrator. All CSEA represented employees rated at the same level 
of  overall  performance  on  the  same  campus  shall  receive  the  same  percentage 
increase to the nearest tenth of a percent. This increase shall be an increase to the 
employees  base salary except for those employees at the top of the salary range as 
described  in  provision  20.21(e).  In  no  event  shall  an  MSI  increase  cause  an 
employeeâ€™s salary rate to exceed the maximum of the range. 

e. 

In cases where bargaining unit employees have reached the top of the classification 
salary  range  or  sub-range  in  the  salary  schedule  in  Appendix  E,  the  percentage 
increase for an MSI shall be in the form of a lump sum bonus based on the annual 
gross earnings between 7/1/99 and 6/30/2000. 

f.  During  the  fiscal  year  2000/2001,  the  amount  of  the  compensation  pool  funds 
assigned  to  the  MSI  program  shall  be  $6,235,900  excluding  associated  benefits 
costs.  The  above  sum  of  $6,235,900  for  fiscal  year  2000/2001  shall  be 
proportionally  allocated  to  individual  campuses  based  upon  the  salary  base  of 
CSEA represented employees on each campus. MSI Compensation pool funds may 
be  augmented  with  campus  funds.  The  effective  date  for  an  MSI  shall  be  July  1, 
2000. 

g.  The  implementation  of  the  MSI  program  as  described  in  provision 20.21 requires 
changes to the salary schedule and other components of the compensation program 
including  but  not  limited  to  the  SBSI  program.  All  of  these  changes  required  to 
implement provision 20.21 are in effect only for fiscal year 2000/2001 and shall not 
be extended without the express written consent of both CSEA and the CSU. This 
provision  shall  not  supercede  the  work  of  the  Labor  Management  Committee 
(LMC) as described in Section 20.22. The work of the LMC shall be extended into 
fiscal year 2000/2001. 

h.  The  decision  of  the  President,  the  Presidentâ€™s  designee,  or  other  appropriate 
administrator  as  to  who  is  to  receive  an  MSI  and  the  percent  amount  for  each 
performance  rating  level  of  the  MSI  shall  not  be  subject  to  Article  7,  Grievance 
Procedure,  unless  the  employee  alleges  that  he  or  she  did  not  receive  the  same 
percent  increase  to  the  nearest  tenth  of  a  percent  as  other  employees  at  the  same 
performance rating level, or if the employee alleges that an exisitng overall rating 
was  changed  for  the  sole  and  express  purpose  of  denying  an  MSI.  Performance 
evaluations  shall  not  be  subject  to  Article  7,  Grievance  Procedure,  unless  the 

grievant alleges the procedures in the provisions of Article 10 or this Section have 
been violated, misinterpreted, or misapplied.

The  President  may  approve  requests  for  participation  in  continuing  education  activities  from 
eligible full-time employees for up to thirty-two (32) hours per calendar year. Employees working less than 
full-time  shall  be  eligible  for  continuing  education  on  a  pro  rata  share.  Such  requests  shall  not  be 
unreasonably denied. Any denial shall be within seven (7) days of the employee's written request. 

The  above  notwithstanding,  the  appropriate  administrator  may  grant  additional  release  time  for 

continuing education activities at the request of the employee. Such requests shall be carefully considered. 
  
22.36  
  

In  cases  where  a  total  of  thirty-two  (32)  hours  participation  in  required  continuing education 
activities are not approved by the President in a calendar year, presidential approval may be granted in the 
calendar year immediately following, for a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours, less any time approved in

The  CSU  recognizes  the  importance  of  procedures  for  the  protection  of  health  and  safety  of 
employees  and  shall  endeavor  to  maintain  such  conditions  conducive  to  the  health  and  safety  of  the 
employees.  In  the  event  of  earthquake,  other  natural  disasters,  or  a  state  of  emergency  declared  by  a 
President,  the  CSU  shall  endeavor  to  take  necessary  health  and  safety  measures  as  required.  At  an 
appropriate  time,  the  CSU  agrees  to  meet  with  the  Union  to  review  such  measures  taken  during  an 
earthquake or other natural disaster. 
  
23.2  
  

Safety  equipment  and  protective  safety  clothing  shall  be  provided  and  maintained,  when  it  is 
deemed necessary by the President to maintain safe and healthful conditions. Such equipment and clothing

An employee who observes or detects any safety hazard shall report it first to his/her immediate 
supervisor or appropriate administrator as soon as possible, and may report it to the Environmental Health 
and Safety Officer. 
  
23.5  
  

Recommendations and suggestions regarding safety presented by an employee or the Union shall 
be considered. When such recommendations and suggestions are submitted to the appropriate administrator 
and  to  the  Environmental  Health  and Safety Officer in writing, the employee shall receive a response in 
writing giving the disposition of such a recommendation or suggestion. 
  
23.6  

  

When an employee in good faith believes that he/she is being required to work under unhealthy or 
unsafe  conditions,  he/she  shall  notify  the  appropriate  administrator.  The  appropriate  administrator  shall 
investigate  as  soon  as  possible  the  alleged  unhealthy  or  unsafe  conditions  and  shall  immediately 
communicate  with  the  employee  as  to  the  results  of  such  an  investigation and, if deemed necessary, the 
steps that shall be taken to correct the condition. 
  
23.7  

  
An  employee  may  request  a  temporary  reassignment  when  he/she  believes  in  good  faith  that 
his/her  present  assignment  presents  a  clear  danger  to  his/her  health  and  safety.  The  appropriate 
administrator  shall  promptly  respond  to  such  a  request.  Such  a  request  shall  not  be  unreasonably  denied 
during the preliminary aspect of any investigation. If such an unsafe or unhealthy condition is found during 
such  an  investigation, the temporary reassignment shall continue until a remedy is implemented. If, after 
the remedy is implemented, the employee still believes the unsafe or unhealthy condition exists, he/she may 
contact  the  Environmental  Health  and  Safety  Officer. The Environmental Health and Safety Officer shall 
respond to the employee as soon as possible.

One  campus  employee  from  bargaining  units  2,  5,  7,  and  9  shall  be  designated  by  CSEA  to 
represent  the  safety  interests  of  employees  in  these  bargaining units. The names of these individuals shall 
be  provided  in  writing  to  the  President.  Such  representation  shall  be  by  membership  on  the  existing 
campus-wide  safety  committee.  Such  a  representative  may  submit  agenda  items  related  to  health  and 
safety. Topics may include, but shall not be limited to, the use of video display terminals (VDTs) and other 
appropriate safety matters. This provision shall not preclude other bargaining unit employees from serving 
on  the  campus-wide  safety  committee  when  appointed  by  means  other  than  those  provided  in  this 
provision. Where there is no existing campus-wide safety committee, the designated unit representative(s) 
may meet with the Environmental Health and Safety Officer in order to address issues of health and safety 
affecting their units. 
  
23.9  
  

There  shall  be  a  campus  Plant  Operations  Safety  Committee  which  shall  meet  at  regularly 
scheduled times during normal business hours. A reasonable number of employee representatives appointed 
by the Union shall serve as committee members. Committee members may place items related to health and 
safety on the agenda for such committee meetings. Recommendations and suggestions regarding safety as 
submitted  in  accordance  with  Provision  23.5  are  appropriate  as  an  agenda  item  for  such  committee 
meetings.

or lack of funds, the following procedures shall apply. 
  
Union Notice 
  
24.2  
  

On a campus when the Employer determines that a layoff is necessary because of a lack of work 

  
23.10  
  

When  available,  upon  the  Union's  written  request,  the  Employer  shall  furnish  campus  disaster 
plans  and  the  Material  Safety  Data  Sheets  on  hazardous  substances  used  by  unit  employees.  Where 
available, other similar information, such as an Injury and Illness Prevention Program, shall be provided to 
the Union or an employee, upon written request and within the requirements of the law. 
  
23.11  
  

As  deemed  necessary  by  the  President,  the  CSU  shall  provide  safety  training  and  instruction to 

When the CSU determines that there is a need for implementation of any procedures outlined in 
this Article, the CSU agrees to immediately notify the Union. The Union may submit a written request to

Order of Layoff 
  
24.3  
  

Layoff  shall  be  within  classifications  determined  by  the  President.  For  classifications  with  skill 
levels,  layoff  shall  be  within  skill  level  determined  by  the  President.  Twelve (12) month, 11/12 month, 
10/12  month  and  academic  year  positions  with  the  same  class  title  shall,  for  the  purposes  of  layoff,  be 
considered a single classification. The order of layoff shall be: 
  

a. 

first, temporary and probationary employees; and 

 

  

b. 

last, permanent employees. 

Temporary  and  probationary  employees  in  a  classification  shall  be  separated  or  laid  off  before 
permanent  employees  in  the  same  classification.  Non-reappointment  of  a  temporary  employee  does  not 
constitute  a  layoff.  For  classifications  with  skill  levels,  temporary  and  probationary  employees  shall  be 
separated or laid off before permanent employees in the same skill level. 
  
Temporary and Probationary Employees 
  
24.4  
  

The  President  shall  establish  the  order  of  layoff  for  temporary  and probationary employees in a 

classification or in a skill level within a classification by considering only the following factors: 
  

a.  merit and competency in relation to program need; and 
 
b.  affirmative action needs of the campus. 

 
Permanent Employees 
  
24.5  
  

The  President  shall  establish  the  order  of  layoff  for  permanent  employees  in  a  classification  in 
reverse order of seniority. For employees in classifications with skill levels, the President shall establish the 
order of layoff for permanent employees in a skill level in reverse order of seniority. 
  
24.6  
  

An employee who possesses documentable specialized skills that are needed for the program, not 
possessed by other employees in classification(s), or skill levels within classifications, undergoing  layoff, 
may be excluded by the President from the layoff list. 
  
Computation of Seniority Points for Permanent Employees 
  
24.7  
  

All  seniority  points  calculated  for  and  earned  by  permanent  employees  prior  to  June  30,  1983, 
shall  remain  unchanged.  Such  seniority points shall serve as the base to which additional seniority points, 
computed for and earned pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be added. Seniority points for each 
campus shall be calculated by the campus and provided to the Union by the Office of the Chancellor two 
(2)  times  per  year  upon  written  request  by  the  Union  and  when  the  CSU  determines  that  a  layoff  is 
necessary. 
  
24.8  
  

Full-time permanent employees shall earn one (1) seniority point of service credit in a given class, 
or  skill  level  within  a  class,  for  each  qualifying  month  of  employment.  Part-time  employees  holding 
permanent status shall earn seniority points proportional to the timebase served. 
  
24.9  
  

For  the  purpose  of  computing  permanent  employee  seniority  credit,  length  of  service  includes 
continuous time served as a temporary, probationary or permanent employee and is counted from the date 
of appointment to the current class held, or current skill level held within the classification, consistent with 
Provision 24.10 below, plus any service in all classes or skill levels of equal or higher rank on the campus, 
including  time  spent  in  non-CSEA  classifications,  which  has  not  been  interrupted  by  a  permanent 
separation. 
  
24.10  

  
Seniority  credit  is  counted  from  the  first  calendar  month  of  appointment  to  the  current 
classification, or skill level within a classification held, or upon the return from leave without pay status 
(when such leave does not count for seniority credit pursuant to Provision 24.12), if the appointment or 
return date is on or before the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of that month. Seniority credit is counted from 
the second calendar month of appointment to the current classification or skill level within a classification 
held, or upon the return from leave without pay status (when such leave does not count for seniority credit 
pursuant  to  Provision  24.12),  if  the  appointment  or  return  date  in  the  first  calendar  month  is  after  the 
fifteenth (15th) calendar day in that month. 
  
24.11  

  

Seniority credit upon separation from a classification, or from a skill level within a classification, 
or upon the commencement of leave without pay status (when such leave does not count for seniority credit 
pursuant to Provision 24.12), shall terminate effective the end of the calendar month preceding the date of 
separation or leave if the date of separation is on or before the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of the month of 
separation.  Seniority  credit  upon  separation  from  a  classification,  or  from  a  skill  level  within  a 
classification, or upon the commencement of leave without pay status (when such leave does not count for 
seniority credit pursuant to Provision 24.12), shall extend until the end of the calendar month of separation 
or leave if the date of separation is after the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of the month of separation. 
  
24.12  
  

All  time  spent  in  family  care,  military,  disability,  loan  of  an  employee  to  another  governmental 
agency  or  leave  with  pay  status  shall  count  toward  the  accumulation  of  seniority  points. All other time 
spent in leave without pay status, as well as periods of suspension without pay, shall not count toward the 
accumulation of seniority points, however, such time shall not constitute a break in continuous service. 
  
24.13  
  

For all permanent ten (10) month employees, one (1) point shall be credited for each month of the 
ten (10) months of employment. Those full-time, permanent employees participating in the 10/12, 11/12 or 
academic pay plan shall receive one (1) point of credited service for each of the twelve (12) months. 
  
24.14  
  

In no case shall a permanent employee earn more than twelve (12) seniority points per year. 

  
24.15  
  

In the event a class is abolished or the use of the class restricted and a new class established in its 

place, all time served in the prior comparable class shall be counted as service in the new class. 
  
24.16  
  

The term "class of equal rank" as used in this Article shall mean a class, or skill level within a 
class, which has a maximum salary of not more than one-half (1/2) step or approximately two and one-half 
percent (2 1/2%) above or below the maximum salary of the employee's current class, or skill level within a 
class. 
  
24.17  

  
The term "class of higher rank" as used in this Article shall mean a class, or skill level within a 
class,  which  has  a  maximum  salary  of  more  than  one-half  (1/2)  step  or  approximately  two  and  one-half 
percent (2 1/2%) above the maximum salary of the employee's current class, or skill level within a class. 
  
Tie-Breaking in the Order of Layoff 
  
24.18  
  

A tie exists when two (2) or more permanent employees in a classification, or skill level within a 

classification, undergoing layoff have the same number of seniority points. 
  
24.19  
  

The  President  shall  break  ties  in  establishing  the  layoff  order  of  permanent  employees  by 

considering only the following factors: 

  

 

 

a. 

specialized skills and competencies of the employee; 

b.  documented meritorious service by the employee; and 

c.  affirmative action needs of the campus. 

  
Employee Notice of Layoff 
  
24.20  
  

A  temporary  or  probationary  employee  who  is  to  be  laid  off  shall  receive  notice  of  such  layoff 

from the President no later than forty-five (45) days before the effective date of layoff. 
  
24.21  
  

A permanent employee who is to be laid off shall receive notice of such layoff from the President 
no later than sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of layoff. Such notice shall be in writing and mailed 
by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the employee's last known address. 
  
Employee Options in Lieu of Layoff 
  
24.22  
  

A  permanent  employee  who  has  received  a  notice  of  layoff  may  exercise  his/her  right  to  elect 
transfer to any vacancy for which he/she is currently qualified. Such qualification shall be determined in the 
normal  manner.  When  two  (2)  or  more  such  permanent  employees  elect  transfer  to  the  same  vacancy  in 
accordance  with  this  provision,  the  President  may  select  the  employee  to  be  transferred  on  the  basis  of 
merit. 
  
24.23  

  

      A permanent or probationary employee who has received a notice of layoff may elect to be transferred 
or  demoted  to  any  classification,  or  skill  level  within  a  classification,  in  which  he/she  has  served  as  a 
permanent employee during the period preceding the layoff, provided there has been no break in service. 
  
24.24  

  
A  permanent  employee  at  the  Chancellor's  Office  who  has  received  a  layoff  notice  shall  have 
retreat rights to his/her former campus if he/she had gained permanency at that campus. Such retreat rights 
exist only if the employee's appointment at the Chancellor's Office was immediately after separation from 
the campus. 
  
24.25  
  

If an employee elects a demotion in lieu of layoff, his/her salary shall be red circled in accordance 

with the red circle rate provisions in Article 20, Salary. 
  
24.26  
  

In order to elect the options in Provisions 24.22-24.25 above, an employee must notify the campus 
Human  Resources  Office  in  writing  of  his/her  election  not  later  than  thirty  (30)  days  after  receiving  the 
notice of layoff. 
  
24.27  
  

An  employee replaced by the demotion or transfer of an employee who has received a notice of 

layoff shall have the same rights as outlined in Provisions 24.22-24.25 above of this Article. 
  
Reemployment Rights/Opportunities 
  
24.28  
  

The  President  shall  enter  the  names  of  laid-off permanent employees on a reemployment list by 
class, or by skill level within a classification, in order of seniority. An employee's name shall remain on the 
reemployment list until he/she returns to a position in the same class, or skill level within a classification, 
held at the time of layoff and at the same timebase as previously held. In no case shall a name remain on 
the reemployment list for more than five (5) years. 
  
24.29  
  

Position  vacancies  in  a  class,  or  skill  level  within a classification, for which there are names of 
qualified  individuals  on  the  reemployment  list  shall  not  be  filled  without  first  making  an  offer  of 
reemployment to those on this list. If an individual on the reemployment list declines two (2) such offers, 
he/she  waives  his/her  reemployment  rights.  An  individual  on  a  reemployment  list  may  request  inactive 
status for up to one (1) year. 
  
24.30  
  

An employee reemployed under the conditions of this Article shall retain permanent status rights, 
service  credit  (subject  to  Public  Employees'  Retirement  System  (PERS)  regulations),  salary  steps,  sick 
leave, and seniority credits he/she held at the date of layoff. 
  
24.31  
  

The CSU shall provide a job clearinghouse to advise and inform employees in classifications,  or 

skill levels within classifications, undergoing layoff of employment opportunities at other campuses. 

The  services  of  the  clearinghouse  shall  be  available  upon  request  to  permanent  employees  in 
receipt of notice of layoff or former permanent employees on a reemployment list. A campus may not fill a 
vacancy without ascertaining whether such an employee or former employee has applied. 

If such an employee has applied for a vacancy, his/her application shall be considered. 

At least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of a layoff, the President shall make available 

  
Voluntary Programs to Avoid Layoff

voluntary programs to avoid layoff. 
  
24.33  
  

Such programs shall include, but shall not be limited to: 

a.  a voluntary reduced worktime program; 
A  voluntary  reduced  worktime  program  may  reduce  the  time  worked  by  an  employee  within  the 
workweek or within the workyear. The 10/12 or 11/12 pay plan as provided for in this Agreement shall 
be considered a voluntary reduced worktime program. Prior to a  layoff, the President shall extend the 
provisions  of  the  10/12  or  11/12  pay  plan  (Article  20,  Salary,  Provisions  20.12  through  20.22)  to 
employees in classifications undergoing layoff and may extend the provisions of the 10/12 or 11/12

Memorandum of Understanding between the California State University (CSU) and the California 
State Employees Association (CSEA) for the Implementation of The Public Safety Support Classifications 
and the Public Affairs/Media/Arts Classifications.

The parties agree that the new Public Safety Support classifications, and the new Public 

Affairs/Media/Arts classifications, shall be implemented according to the conversion road map as identified 
in Appendices A, and B, and C. The classifications of employees shall be converted from those listed in the 

"Current Classifications" column to those listed in the "New Classification/Level" column.  There shall be 
no increase in salary for any employee as a result of the conversion of his/her existing classification to the 
listed classification identified in the road map conversion. Therefore, the implementation of the Public 
Safety Support classifications, and the Public Affairs/Media/arts classifications, shall result in no costs to
