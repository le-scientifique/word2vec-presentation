TO CUE MEMBERS: 
 
This document has been prepared to allow each member to have a chance to see the tentative contract language 
in order to make an informed decision on whether or not to vote to ratify the CUE bargaining team's tentative 
agreement with UC.  There may be some typographical errors in this, but they will be fixed before the contract is 
printed, if it is ratified.  An example is that in the WAGES article, there is no section "B," though there is an "A" and 
a "C".  There is no text missing, but the existing outline format is clearly flawed and will need to be fixed if the 
language is ratified. 
 
This is a long document, and the CUE bargaining team has prepared the enclosed summary to aid you in your 
considerations. 
 
If you have questions about the meaning of any of this language, please contact any of the members of CUE's 
bargaining team, who are listed elsewhere in this packet 
 

 

ACCESS/UNION RIGHTS 

 
A.   GENERAL PROVISIONS  
 

1.  

The parties acknowledge that it is in the union's interest that it be granted access to University facilities 
for the purposes of ascertaining whether the terms of this Agreement are being met; engaging in the 
investigation, preparation, and adjustment of grievances; conducting union meetings; explaining to 
bargaining unit members their rights and responsibilities under the Agreement; and informing CUE 
employees of union activities. In the interest of facilitating these purposes, and in accordance with local 
campus/Laboratory/hospital procedures, the parties agree to this Article.  

 

2.  

The University has the right to enforce reasonable access rules and regulations as promulgated at 
each campus/Laboratory/hospital.  

 
B.   ACCESS BY THE UNION/UNION REPRESENTATIVES - GENERAL PROVISIONS  
 

1.   Designated union representatives who are not University employees, or who are not employed at the 
facility visited, may visit the facility at reasonable times and upon notice to discuss with the University 
or bargaining unit members matters pertaining to this Agreement. In the case of visits for the purpose 
of conducting unscheduled meetings with bargaining unit members, the union representative shall give 
notice upon arrival in accordance with local campus/Laboratory/hospital procedures.  

2.   CUE will furnish the University with a written list of all CUE representatives, CUE designated employee 
representatives and officers who are authorized by the union to conduct union business.  This list shall 
be maintained in a timely manner by CUE and any changes, additions or deletions to the list must be 
made in writing to the University.  

3.   Such internal union business as membership recruitment, campaigning for union office, handbilling or 

other distribution of literature, and all other union activities shall take place during non-work time.  
Employee rest and meal periods are non-work time for the purposes of this Article.  

 

 

 
C.   EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES  
 

1.  

The University shall recognize CUE designated employee representatives who are members of the 
bargaining unit. The function of the CUE designated employee representative shall be to inform 
employees of their rights under this Agreement, to ascertain that the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement are being observed, and to investigate and assist in the processing of grievances.  

For the purposes of receiving paid release time as provided in this section, CUE may designate four 
University employees as "CUE designated employee representatives" at each 
campus/Laboratory/hospital.  Additionally, in the event campus/hospital/laboratory has more than 
200employees, CUE may designate one additional CUE-designated employee representative for each 

 

2.  

additional 100 bargaining unit members thereafter, up to a maximum of thirty (30) CUE-designated 
employee representatives.  CUE shall not designate more than one CUE designated employee 
representative per department unless the department has more than 200 employees in which case 
there can be up to 1 per 100 CX employees.  The department CUE reps may not be from the same 
smaller unit (4 or less CX employees) of such a large department.  

a.   The total cumulative use of paid release time for the CUE designated employee representative 

shall be limited to 10hours in any one month.  University convened meetings pursuant to Article - 
Grievance Procedure, shall not be deducted from this block of time.  

 

b.   The use of the maximum of 10 hours shall be for grievance-related activity such as:  

1)  

2)  

3)  

the initial hand-delivered filing of a grievance and the retrieval of University documents 
provided pursuant to a written request for information related to a grievance;  

one-on-one meetings with a grievant concerning a filed grievance, or an alleged violation of 
this Agreement which is at the Informal Review stage of Article - Grievance Procedure;  

meetings with the University representative to whom written grievances are presented or to 
whom documents related to filed grievance are presented/signed or with whom time limit 
agreements are achieved;  

4)  

Informal Review meetings held pursuant to 'E. of Article- Grievance Procedure.  

c.   A request for release time will be made to the CUE designated employee representative's 

supervisor prior to the activity. Such approval shall be granted solely on the basis of operational 
needs and shall not be denied unreasonably.  

d.   At its sole discretion, the University may authorize use of release time for more than 10 hours in a 
month per department.  The exercise of this discretion and/or the enforcement by the University of 
the 10-hour maximum shall under no circumstances establish a precedent for the CUE designated 
employee representative or department involved nor shall the allowance of greater than 10 hours in 
a month for a CUE designated employee representative have any effect or bearing on the ability of 
the University to enforce the 10-hour maximum on any other CUE designated employee 
representative.  

e.   Should a question of possible abuse of these release time provisions arise, the University will so 

notify CUE, and the parties will attempt to resolve the matter.  If a question remains, the University 
may take corrective action when warranted.  

 
D.   MEETING ROOMS AND BULLETIN BOARDS  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.   CUE shall be granted use of general purpose meeting rooms.  Such use shall be arranged in advance 

with the designated campus/Laboratory/hospital office and will not be unreasonably denied.  Room 
reservations shall not be canceled by the University except where unforeseen circumstances require 
the room to be used for purposes such as teaching, or patient care-related purposes or staff 
conferences.  If a reserved room is canceled, the University will attempt to provide a comparable 
alternative.  

2.   CUE shall have access to general purpose bulletin boards and shall have the use of those bulletin 

boards.  Any materials posted must be dated and initialed by the union representative responsible for 
the posting and a copy of all materials posted must be provided to the appropriate University 
representative at the location at the time of posting.  At those locations where the University is 
responsible for posting material on bulletin boards, the University will post copies of the CUE-provided 
material within one business day.  

United States mail which is received by the University bearing an employee name and accurate address will 
be placed in the employee mailboxes in the normal manner.  In departments where employee mailboxes 
exist, the union shall have reasonable use of them.  In departments where individual mailboxes are in a 
restricted work area, CUE may make arrangements with the responsible University official in the restricted 
work area to have the CUE mail placed in the employee mailboxes.  Where mailboxes do not exist for 
employees, the University will distribute CUE mail to employees by the normal method.  

E.   MAIL DELIVERY  
 
 

 
F.   EMPLOYEE LISTS  
 

1.   On a yearly basis, the University shall provide CUE with an alphabetized list by 

campus/Laboratory/hospital of all employees at each campus/Laboratory/hospital.  This list will be on 
disk and will contain the name, title, campus mailing address, appointment type, last date of hire with 
continuous employment, pay rate, and department to which the employee is assigned.  Home address 
will be provided if the employee has agreed to release of the home address.  CUE shall pay for the 
initial programming of such information upon execution of the Agreement.  CUE will provide the 
University with a check not to exceed $700 to cover the cost of production of the list.  The University 
agrees to provide CUE with an initial list no later than 90 days of receipt of the check and will provide 
monthly lists from that date forward.  The list will include the most accurate and complete information 
available to the University.  

2.   Once each month, beginning 30 days after provision of the initial list, each campus/Laboratory/hospital 
will provide to CUE a list of changes (e.g., salary adjustment, new hire, transfer, promotion, discharge, 
home address, etc.) that have occurred within the bargaining unit.  

3.   Until imposition of 'F.I. and 'F.2. above, the previous practice regarding master lists will remain in effect.  

 
G.   PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF AGREEMENT  
 

1.   A copy of this Agreement shall be given by the University to each employee in the Bargaining Unit.  

The University and CUE shall split the cost of printing contracts for unit members.  In addition, the 
parties shall each pay for the number of copies they need for administrative and other purposes.  

The University shall provide CUE a copy of the tentative agreement language on diskette within seven 
working days of reaching tentative agreement.  A camera-ready copy will be provided to CUE within 30 
calendar days from the parties' agreement of the final text.  Within 20 calendar days of CUE's receipt of 
the camera-ready copy, CUE shall confirm the final copy or meet with the University to review 
corrections.  The University shall then deliver the agreed upon camera-ready copy to the UC Printing 
Services.  Within 20 calendar days of receipt of the "blue line" from UC Printing Services, the University 
shall notify CUE to meet and review the "blue line."  At that time, CUE shall pay the University one-half 
of the estimated cost of the agreement for the unit members.  Upon receipt of full payment from CUE, 
each location shall distribute the agreement to members of the unit within 75 calendar days.  

 

 

 
I.  
 
 

 

2.  

 
H.   TELEPHONE  
 
 

Employee representatives may use University telephones for the purpose of conducting union business 
which is specifically authorized by Article - Grievance Procedure. Employees are responsible for paying any 
costs associated with such telephone usage in accordance with the departmental procedures in effect at the 
time. The frequency and duration of permitted phone calls shall not be such as to interfere with or disrupt the 
employee's completion of work assignments, nor impair the efficiency of University operations.  The 
University may audit employee representatives' use of the telephone system to the same extent as it may 
audit other employees use of such equipment.  

E-MAIL USE  

CUE designated employee representatives may use their University e-mail account for the purpose of 
conducting union business which is specifically authorized by Article -Grievance Procedure. Such use shall 

also conform to and be in accordance with applicable University policy regarding electronic mail/electronic 
communications.  

 
J.   New Employee Orientations  
 

1.  

The University shall notify CUE in advance of scheduled new employee orientations, if any, upon 
request of the local CUE representative.  

2.   At the University's new employee orientation, if any, packets of information supplied by CUE shall be 

made available.  

3.   CUE shall be permitted to meet with the new Clerical employees according to 

campus/hospital/laboratory timetables and practices immediately after new employee orientation 
sessions, if any, for the purpose of sharing information with new clerical employees.  

4.  

 
5.  

Information about the time and location of the CUE meeting shall be announced at the new employee 
orientation meeting, if any. Employees may attend CUE's meeting on non-work time such as lunch or 
break times.  

The University and CUE agree to meet and confer over arrangements to accomplish the goals of this 
section.

1.  

Long Term Leave Of Absence Without Pay  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a.   Upon at least thirty (30) calendar days advance written request from CUE and the employee, the 

University shall grant one (1) CUE-represented employee per hospital/campus/Laboratory an 
extended leave of absence without pay to engage in union business. The union/employee shall 
specify the duration of the extended leave of absence at the time the employee requests the leave. 
No such leave shall be granted unless the written request specifies the duration of the leave.  

b.   Long-term leaves of absence shall be for a period of not less than one (1) year. In no situations 

shall the University grant a long-term leave of absence for a period of more than three (3) years.  

c.   During the leave of absence, the employee shall be in a "without pay and without benefits" status. 
Furthermore, during the employee's leave of absence the University shall in no way be obligated to 
provide pay or benefits for the employee. The employee may purchase benefits in accordance with 
plan regulations.  

d.   The University, due to operational requirements, may postpone the date a long-term leave of 

absence without pay is scheduled to begin.  

2.   Short Term Leave  

a.   Subject to operational considerations, upon at least thirty (30) calendar days' written request from 

CUE and the employee, the University will grant a short-term leave of absence without pay for 
union business to one (1) employee per hospital/campus/Laboratory per calendar year. Such 
leaves may not exceed twelve (12) consecutive months.  

b.   Requests for short-term leave shall not be unreasonably denied.  

c.   During the leave of absence, the employee shall be in a "without pay and without benefits" status.  
Furthermore, during the employee's leave of absence the University shall in no way be obligated to

1.   At least forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the completion of the long-term leave of absence, CUE 

shall notify the University of the employee's intent to return to the University's employ and the 
employee shall likewise so advise the University.  

2.   Upon return, the employee shall be placed in the same position from which s/he took the leave of 

absence and at the rate of pay which would place the employee at the same relative position in the 
range for the position as that range exists when the employee returns. Placement of the employee in 
her/his previous position shall be consistent with staffing reductions and/or layoffs, which may have 
occurred during the period of the leave of absence without pay.  

 
C.   ATTENDANCE AT LOCAL MEETINGS  
 
 

 

 

 

 
A. 

 
D.  

 

Upon fourteen calendar days' advance written notice to her/his supervisor, local union officers and local 
employee representatives included on the list provided to the University by CUE, as set forth in Section B.2. 
of Article -, Access, shall be granted time off without pay or, at the employee's option, such time would be 
charged to accrued compensatory time off or accrued vacation time, to attend local union meetings.  
Approval for such leave shall not be granted for a period to exceed four (4) hours and such approval shall not 
be granted to any individual employee more than once per month.  The granting of such approval to local 
employee representatives and officers shall be subject to the operational needs of the University and may be 
granted to one (1) or more but not necessarily all such employees on the same shift in the same operational 
area.  Such approval shall not be unreasonably denied.  

RELEASE TIME FOR BARGAINING 

The University will provide released time for eleven designated team members, no more than one per 
location, in a without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status to attend scheduled bargaining sessions for 
negotiations.  CUE is expected to designate in writing permanent and alternate team members who are 
members of the bargaining unit and in active employment status at least 30 calendar days prior to the first 
bargaining session.  Nothing in this section shall preclude CUE's appointment of a permanent bargaining 
team member during the course of negotiations from a location where a permanent team member had not 
been selected previously.  Substitution of alternate members for permanent members is permitted only upon 
CUE's provision, in writing, of the name and work location of the employee team member alternate seven 
calendar days in advance of the scheduled bargaining session unless the parties agree otherwise. 

 
B.   Such released time in without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status shall be provided only for scheduled 

negotiation sessions and only for days on which the team member would have been scheduled to work.  
Such hours shall not exceed the bargaining team member's actual scheduled work hours for any one day of a 
scheduled bargaining session, not to exceed 40 hours per week.  Such released time shall not count in the 
calculation of overtime or other ancillary pay/premiums. 

 
C.   Bargaining sessions are defined as scheduled face-to-face meetings and related caucuses during meeting 

days for the purpose of negotiating wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.  The travel 
time included in the released time without loss of straight-time pay status is reasonable amount of time for 
direct travel to and from the bargaining team member's place of employment. 

It is expected that employee bargaining team members shall provide their supervisors with written notice of 
all bargaining sessions as soon as practicable following the scheduling of bargaining sessions.  A bargaining 
team member may be denied released time for bargaining, either in paid or unpaid status, if written notice is 
not provided at least 14 calendar days prior to the scheduled bargaining, unless the parties agree otherwise.  
In the event a bargaining session is scheduled with less than 14 calendar days advance notice, the University 
will make every effort to insure released time for primary and/or permanent alternate to CUE's bargaining 
team. 

AGREEMENT 

This Agreement is made and entered into on (date) at Oakland, California, pursuant to the provisions of 
Articles 1 through 11 of the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) by and between 
The Regents of the University of California, a corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "University" or 
"management" or"employer") represented by the Office of the President of the University of California 
system, and the Coalition of University Employees (hereinafter referred to as CUE or the "Union").  

 
B.   PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT  
 

 
A. 

 

 

 

1.  

It is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto that this Agreement constitutes an implementation of 
the provisions of HEERA and provides for orderly and constructive employment relations in the public 
interest, in the interests of the University, and the interests of the employees represented by CUE.  

 The parties hereby acknowledge that this Agreement represents an amicable understanding reached 
by the parties as a result of the unlimited right and opportunity of the parties to make any and all 
demands with respect to the employer-employee relationship which exists between them relative to the 
scope of bargaining.  

This Agreement recognizes one certified bargaining unit.  Each provision of this Agreement applies to 
that bargaining unit unless specified otherwise.  

 

 

2. 

3.  

 
C.   RECOGNITION  
 

1.   Pursuant to and in conformity with the certifications issued by the Public Employment Relations Board 
(PERB) of the State of California in case number SF-HR-12, the University recognizes CUE as the sole 
and exclusive representative for the purposes of collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours, 
and terms and conditions of employment for all employees, excluding employees designated as 
managerial, supervisory and/or confidential by the University as of November 21, 1997 and all student 
employees whose employment is contingent upon their status as students, in the following described 
bargaining unit: 

a.   Unit #12 - Clerical and Allied Services (SF-HR-12)  

2.  

The term "employee" as used in this Agreement shall refer to employees of the University of California 
including the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ("Laboratory") in the above-mentioned unit except 
for those excluded pursuant to C.l. above.  

3.  

The classes and title codes included in Unit 12 are listed in Appendices A and B.  

 
D.   WAIVER OF UNIT MODIFICATION AND RECLASSIFICATION OF EXCLUDED POSITIONS  
 
 

The job titles and positions excluded from the unit by the parties' stipulations of July 22, 1997 and by PERB's 
Consent Election Order of May 20, 1997 shall be conclusively deemed to be managerial, supervisory, or 
confidential, or any indicated combination thereof, as shown on the list appended to said stipulation, and CUE 
expressly waives for the duration of this Agreement any right it may have to seek to include any such title or 
stipulation by unit modification.  CUE recognizes that the University has the exclusive right to establish new 
title codes and titles for any such excluded position or title.  The University shall advise CUE of any such new 
title.  In the event the University elects not to establish a new title for some or all excluded positions currently 
classified in included titles, the University shall, during the term of this Agreement, provide the Union with a 
list, by bargaining unit and by campus/hospital/Laboratory location, of the excluded positions which remain 
within included titles and the incumbents at that time, if any.  The failure to include an excluded position on 
any such list shall not be evidence that the position should be included in any unit.  

 
E.   RECLASSIFICATION FROM UNIT TO NON-UNIT POSITIONS  
 
 

In the event the University determines that a position should be reclassified or designated for exclusion with 
the result that the position would be removed from the unit, it shall notify the Union in writing at least 60 

calendar days before proposed implementation, with a statement of the reasons for the proposed 
reclassification or exclusion.  Upon written notice from CUE, the parties shall meet and confer at least 30 
calendar days before the intended date of implementation, unless the parties agree otherwise.  Any 
unresolved disputes which remain following these discussions may be submitted to PERB for resolution.  At 
the end of the 60 calendar day period the University may implement the proposed change pending the final 
resolution by the PERB process.  

 
F.   NEW CLASSES  
 

1.   When the University creates a new class and title within the occupational subgroups (OSG) included in 

the bargaining unit, the University shall mail a notice to the union of the bargaining unit assignment, if 
any, of such class at least 60 calendar days before the proposed date of implementation.  The notice to 
the union shall include a statement of reason(s) for the creation of the new class.  The Union shall have 
45 calendar days from the date of such notice to contest the University's assignment.  If the Union 
contests the assignment, the University and the Union shall meet and confer in an effort to reach 
agreement on the bargaining unit assignment for the class.  If the parties are unable to reach 
agreement, the dispute shall be submitted to PERB pursuant to Regulation 32781 (a)(2) for resolution.  
If the Union does not contest the bargaining unit assignment within the 30 calendar day notice period, 
the unit assignment of the new class shall be deemed agreeable to the parties and PERB shall be so 
advised.  Bargaining unit assignments made by the University which are contested by the Union shall 
remain as originally assigned by the University until such time as the parties are in mutual agreement 
as to a different assignment or, if such assignment is referred to PERB within the appeal period stated 
above, until resolution of the matter by the PERB process.  

2. 

If the inclusion of a new class within the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement is agreed to by the 
parties or found appropriate by PERB, the University shall assign a pay rate to the class.  

3.   Assignment by the University of the pay rate to a new class as indicated above shall be consistent with 
the existing compensation and classification methodologies utilized by the University at the time of the 
assignment.  

 
4.  

If the new classification is in the bargaining unit in accordance with the provisions of Section F.1-3 
above, the University shall notify CUE of the proposed range and ancillary pay practice to be 
implemented.  If CUE notifies UC within 15 days of receipt of the notice it wishes to bargain the 
change(s), the parties shall meet and confer regarding the salary range and ancillary pay practices for 
the classification.  Meet and confer shall commence no later than 30 calendar days following the 
Union's request, unless the parties agree otherwise.  

 
G.   ABOLITION OF CLASSES  
 

The University will provide CUE with 60 calendar days' notice of its intent to abolish a classification.  The 
notice to the Union shall include a statement of the reason(s) for the abolition.  Upon written request from 
CUE, the parties will meet and confer over the effects at least 30 days before the intended date of 
implementation unless the parties agree otherwise.  The University shall not abolish the class unless the 
parties have reached agreement through the meet and confer process over effects of the decision, or 
conclusion of the impasse process.  
Access/Union Rights 

 

 

 
 

 

 
A.   GENERAL CONDITIONS  
 

ARBITRATION PROCEDURE 

1.   An appeal to arbitration may be made only by the union and only after the timely exhaustion of Article - 
Grievance Procedure.  The appeal to arbitration must be signed by the President of CUE, or designee, 
and filed with the Office of Labor Relations, Office of the President.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a.   When hand delivered, proof of service must accompany the appeal to arbitration.  The date of 

receipt will be used to determine the date of the appeal for hand-delivered appeals. 

b.   When mailed, the appeal must arrive in an envelope with a U.S. Postal Service Postmark.  The 

U.S. Postal Service Postmark will be used to determine the date of the appeal for mailed appeals.  

2.  

For the purposes of this Article, time limits are calculated in calendar days, unless otherwise stated and 
deadlines which fall on a day which is not a location business day will automatically be extended to the 
next business day.  All time limits may be extended by written agreement of the parties in advance of 
the expiration of the time limit.  The union's failure to meet any time limit, or extension to a time limit, 
will render the Appeal to Arbitration ineligible for further processing and the University's preceding 
written answer will be considered final.  

3.  

If the appeal to arbitration is withdrawn, the last preceding University written response will be 
considered final.  

4.  

The decision of the arbitrator on any issue properly before him or her shall be final and binding.  

5.   An appeal to arbitration shall not prohibit efforts by the University and CUE to resolve the grievance 

during the time the appeal is pending and until such time that an arbitrator has rendered his or her 
decision.  

6.   CUE shall have full authority to settle, withdraw or otherwise dispose of any grievance brought on 

behalf of the union and/or on the behalf of employees.  An agreement by the parties to settle, withdraw, 
or otherwise dispose of a grievance appealed to arbitration shall be binding upon the grievants.  

7.   Where two or more grievances are appealed to arbitration, all grievances by or related to the same 

employee(s), or grievances which relate to the same incident, issue or course of action, may be 
consolidated by agreement of the parties.  

8. 

An appeal of an expedited grievance to arbitration may be made only by CUE in accordance with this 
section.  Requests for arbitration under the expedited grievance, 'F.2.e. of Article - Grievance 
Procedure must include a copy of the completed Grievance form.  

9.  

Time Limits  

a.   Initial filing - An appeal to arbitration must be filed within 30 calendar days of the issuance of the 

University's Step 3 decision to the union or Step 2 decision in the case of an expedited grievance 
appealed to arbitration.  

b.   University Acknowledgment of Receipt - Within 15 calendar days of the postmark or, in the case of 
hand delivery the date of receipt of the union's appeal to arbitration, the University shall mail to the 
union an acknowledgment of the receipt of the appeal and the identity of the location to which all 
relevant correspondence should be directed.  

c.   Selecting the Arbitrator and Scheduling the Hearing Date -  

i.   

Within 45 calendar days from the date the grievance was originally appealed to arbitration, 
CUE shall contact the University to select an arbitrator according to 'C of this Article.  The 
scheduling of the arbitration hearing date must be accomplished no later than 90 calendar 
days from the date the grievance was originally appealed to arbitration, except as provided 
below in c(iii).  Should the parties be unable to agree to a hearing date, the authority to 
schedule the hearing rests with the arbitrator.  The parties may extend the 90-day limit for 
scheduling the arbitration by mutual written agreement in advance of the expiration of the 
time limit.  

ii.  

In such cases the arbitrator shall be provided with a copy of the written agreement.  Failure 
to select the arbitrator and schedule the hearing according to this section will render the 

grievance ineligible for arbitration and the last preceding University written answer shall 
become final.  

iii.  

If CUE initiates the selection process in writing to the University with a preferred arbitrator 
from the arbitration panel and there is no written University response by the deadline for 
selection of the arbitrator (45 days from CUE's appeal to arbitration), then the CUE choice 
shall be final unless CUE initiates the selection process within 15 business days of the 
deadline for selection of the arbitrator.  In such case, the University shall have 15 business 
days to respond to CUE's choice of an arbitrator and the period for scheduling the 
arbitration hearing shall be extended by 10 business days.  

d.   Should the Union make a request that the grievance which has been appealed to arbitration be 

placed in abeyance for any reason, the period of abeyance shall not exceed 90 days. The Union 
further agrees that grievances placed in abeyance shall have the time limits tolled during this 
period.  Failure by the Union to reactivate the grievance within the 90-day limit following request 
that it be held in abeyance will render the grievance ineligible for arbitration and the last preceding 
University written answer shall become final.  If CUE requests selection of the arbitrator, it shall be 
according to the arbitration selection process in this section, including A.9.c.  

 
B.   EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION  
 
 

 
C.   SELECTION OF ARBITRATOR  
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Union representation at the arbitration hearing may consist of two representatives, with only one 
representative eligible for without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status.  Released time shall not be unreasonably 
denied.  If a second representative requests released time for the hearing, it shall not be unreasonably 
denied and it shall be without pay.  Only one representative may be designated as the employee advocate for 
the course of the hearing.  

Within 45 calendar days of the date of the appeal to arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected using the 
following procedures:  

1.   Until a permanent panel is selected by the parties, on a case-by-case basis, the parties may agree to 
the selection of any qualified and available person to serve as an arbitrator.  Absent such agreement, 
the pates may agree to the selection of an arbitrator from a list provided by the American Arbitration 
Association.  

2.   Once the permanent panel is in place, the parties may mutually agree to an arbitrator.  In the event the 

parties cannot agree to an arbitrator, the parties shall then alternately strike one name each from the 
15 names.  The first strike will be determined by a flip of a coin, and the last name remaining shall be 
the arbitrator.  

3.  

If both parties disagree with the arbitrator who has been selected, the process shall be repeated once 
in its entirety.  

4.   A separate arbitrator shall be selected for each grievance appealed to arbitration, unless the parties 

agree otherwise in writing.  

5.   Except as provided in Section A.9.c.iii of this Article, the parties may agree in writing to extend the 

45-day limit for selecting the arbitrator.  Failure to select the arbitrator within 45 calendar days, or to 
mutually agree to a written extension of the time period, will render the appeal to arbitration ineligible 
for further processing and the University's preceding written answer will be considered final.  

 
D.   SCOPE OF ARBITRATION  
 

1.   Unless there is an agreement by both parties to modify the scope of the hearing, the issue(s) to be 
heard by the arbitrator shall solely and in its entirety be restricted to the issue(s) stated by Step 3.  
Issues or allegations which were known or should have been known to either party but not introduced 

by the Step 3 process shall not be introduced by either party at the arbitration hearing, except as 
provided in 'D.2., below.  

2.  When practicable the University shall inform CUE in writing of its intent to assert the issue of 

arbitrability prior to the selection of the arbitrator in its Acknowledgment of Receipt, according to A.9.b, 
above.  The issue(s) of arbitrability shall be resolved in a hearing prior to and separate from the hearing 
(if any) about the substantive facts and/or allegations in dispute, 'D.3., below.  In such a case, the 
parties shall use the selection process described in Sections A.9 and C above to select two arbitrators.   
The first arbitrator will be selected to hear the issues of arbitrability and the second arbitrator will be 
selected to decide the merits of the case if the issues are determined to be arbitrable.  Unless either 
party requests a full and complete arbitration proceeding on the arbitrability issue, the first arbitrator 
shall issue either a bench decision or, upon either party's request, a written decision within 7 calendar 
days of the completion of the arbitrability hearing.  In the event that the first arbitrator, as a result of the 
arbitrability hearing referenced above determines a matter to be arbitrable, the first arbitrator shall have 
no authority to decide the issues pursuant to the merits of the case.  A hearing on the merits of the 
case will be scheduled with the second arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise.  

If, following the issuance of the University Acknowledgment of the appeal, the University raises for the 
first time issue(s) of arbitrability, a single hearing on the issue of arbitrability and the substantive facts 
will be held, unless the parties agree otherwise.  If the arbitrator finds the grievance ineligible for 
arbitration, the substantive facts of the case need not be heard and the grievance shall be denied.  If 
the arbitrator finds in favor of arbitrability, the hearing shall proceed to the substantive issues raised.  

'D.1. and 'D.2. above, shall not prevent the parties from agreeing in writing to combine the arbitrability 
hearing with the hearing on the merits of the case or from agreeing to separate hearings on arbitrability 
and the merits of the case before a single arbitrator.  

 
E.   ARBITRATION PROCEEDING  
 

1.  

The parties will attempt to agree on a location for the arbitration hearing.  

2.  

3.  

The arbitration hearing shall be closed to anyone other than the participants in the arbitration hearing, 
unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.  

The arbitration hearing shall provide an opportunity for CUE and the University to examine and 
cross-examine witnesses under oath or affirmation, and to submit relevant evidence.  

4.   Settlement offers made any time during the Grievance and/or Arbitration Procedures shall not be 

introduced as evidence in the arbitration hearing.  

5.   Either or both parties may, at their discretion, file briefs with the arbitrator.  The order and time limits of 

briefing shall, on a case-by-case basis, be as agreed upon by the parties or as specified by the 
arbitrator.  Briefing time limits shall be extended by the Arbitrator upon the agreement of both parties.  

The arbitrator shall consider the evidence presented and render a written decision within 30 calendar 
days of the close of the record of the hearing.  

In all cases appealed to arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Article and this Agreement, CUE has 
the burden of initiating the steps in the procedure.  With the exception of those cases in which the issue 
is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article - Corrective Action/Discipline and 
Dismissal, CUE shall have the burden of proof.  The burden of proof in cases in which the issue is that 
of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article - Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal, shall 
be the University's.  

8.   Prior to the hearing, the parties shall endeavor to exchange the names of all known witnesses and 

relevant materials to be introduced at the hearing.

F.   AUTHORITY OF THE ARBITRATOR  
 

1.  

The arbitrators authority shall be limited to determining whether the University has violated the 
provision(s) of this Agreement as set forth in the Union's Step 3 appeal or Step 2 appeal if expedited.  If 
such a violation is found, the arbitrator shall specify the remedy in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement.  

 

 

 

 

2.  

3.  

4.  

5.  

The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify or ignore in any 
way the provisions of this Agreement and shall not make any award that would, in effect, grant CUE or 
the employee(s) any terms which were not obtained in the negotiation process.  

The arbitrator shall have the authority to subpoena documents and to require the attendance of 
witnesses upon the reasonable request of either party but not upon his or her own motion.  

The expense of service and appearance fees, if any, shall be borne entirely by the party requesting the 
subpoena of witnesses and each party shall, in advance of the hearing date, inform the other party of 
the identity of witnesses it subpoenaed.  

The arbitrator shall be the sole judge of the relevancy and materiality of the evidence and testimony 
offered.  The arbitrator may receive and consider evidence but shall give appropriate weight to any 
objections made.  All documents to be considered by the arbitrator shall be filed at the hearing, or 
within the post-hearing time lines agreed to by the parties during the hearing.  

 
G.   ARBITRATION REMEDIES  
 

1.   No remedy by an arbitrator shall be made retroactive to a date earlier than 30 calendar days prior to 

the filing of the Step 1 grievance, except for the correction of an error in implementation in payment of 
wages or the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the 
payment of wages.  For grievances involving the correction of an error in implementation of payment of 
wages or correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment 
of wages, an award of an arbitrator shall not in any case be made retroactive to a date earlier than 
three years prior to the initiation of the written grievance in Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure.  
Additionally, no remedy shall be provided for any period of time during the grievance and/or arbitration 
procedure for which an extension of time limits has been granted at the request of CUE or any time an 
employee was on strike.  

2.  

In any decision of a grievance appealed to arbitration involving retroactive payments, the appropriate 
University and CUE representatives shall expeditiously determine the identity of the payees and the 
specific amount owed each payee.  Such amount of payment shall be final and no employee or group 
of employees may subsequently grieve the amounts owed.  

3.   Remedies involving monetary payment and/or benefits shall be limited in their calculation to the 

utilization of the employee's actual and appropriate wage or benefit amount at the time of the violation 
and shall not include the awarding of interest or any other payment/credit unrelated to a University 
benefit amount or the employee's hourly wage.  

4.   Upon the motion of either party, or at his or her own discretion, an arbitrator may retain jurisdiction in 

cases involving an award of retroactive monetary payment (and/or benefits).  

5.  

If the grievance is sustained in whole or in part, the remedy shall not exceed restoring to the employee 
the pay, benefits or rights lost less any compensation from any source, including but not limited to 
Workers' Compensation, Unemployment Compensation or other employment.  

 

 

 

 

 
H.   COST OF ARBITRATION  
 

1.  

The cost of the arbitrator's fees and expenses of the hearing will be shared equally by the University 
and CUE.  If either party requests that a stenographic record of the hearing be made and/or transcripts 

 

2.  

of the stenographic record or a taped record be provided, the parties shall equally share the entire cost 
of such service and the cost of the provision of a transcript to each party and the arbitrator.  

In the event either party requests the cancellation or postponement of a scheduled arbitration 
proceeding which causes an arbitrator to impose a cancellation or postponement fee, the party 
requesting such cancellation or postponement shall bear the full cost of the cancellation/postponement 
fee.  In the event the parties agree to settle or postpone the arbitration during the period of time in 
which the arbitrator will charge a cancellation/postponement fee, the parties will equally bear the cost of 
the fee, unless the parties agree otherwise.  

PAY STATUS  

1.  

2.  

3.  

The grievant (one grievant in a group grievance) shall be in a without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status at 
the arbitration hearing.  

The University and CUE shall establish a reasonable schedule for witness(es)' testimony at the 
arbitration proceeding.  Employee witnesses who appear at the arbitration hearing at the request of 
CUE shall be in a without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status for reasonable travel time, the time spent 
actually giving testimony and/or waiting to testify in accordance with the established schedule.  Every 
effort shall be made by the University and CUE to avoid the presentation of repetitive witnesses.  The 
parties may agree to use an expedited form of arbitration to be agreed to by the parties and the 
arbitrator.  

Total release time for the grievant, employee representative and witness(es) for travel to/from the 
hearing and for participation in the hearing shall not exceed either their normally scheduled hours of 
work for the day(s) of the hearing or their actual participation in the hearing. Participants shall travel 
to/from the hearing via the most expeditious method of transportation available.  

 
4.   Not more than one employee representative will be released in without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status 

for attendance at any one arbitration hearing.  

5.  

The University shall not be responsible for any lodging, travel expenses or other expenses incurred by 
grievants, witnesses, employee or CUE representatives with regard to the union's presentation in the 
arbitration hearing.  

 
I.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
J.   EXPEDITED ARBITRATION  
 

 
K.   ARBITRATION PANEL  
 

1.  

The parties may agree to use an expedited form of arbitration to be agreed to by the parties and the 
arbitrator.  

The parties will make an attempt to agree on the panel of 30 arbitrators, with 15 on a Northern Panel 
and 15 on a Southern Panel.  Nothing shall preclude the parties from including an arbitrator on both the 
northern and southern lists.  If agreement cannot be reached on the names of the arbitrators on each 
list, the remaining number of arbitrators needed to complete a panel will be selected alternately by the 
parties.  The party selecting first shall be determined by a flip of a coin.  

2.   After one year from the date the panel members were initially selected, and annually thereafter, each 
party shall have the right to eliminate up to one arbitrator from the panel.  A party exercising this right 
shall notify the other party in writing of the name of the arbitrator to be stricken from the panel.  

3.  

In replacing arbitrators who were eliminated from the panel, the procedure in ' K.l. shall be used again 
but any arbitrator eliminated in 'K.2. above, may not be placed back on the panel until at least one year 
from the date on which such arbitrator was stricken.  

4.  

In the event one vacancy in the panel of arbitrators occurs, other than the elimination of an Arbitrator by 
the parties pursuant to 'K.3. above, such vacancy may be filled by the parties within 30 calendar days, 

 

5.  

using the procedures in 'K.l. and 'K.2. above, if the parties agree that a replacement is necessary.  In 
the event more than one vacancy in the panel of arbitrators occurs, such vacancy shall be filled by the 
parties within 30 calendar days by using the procedures in 'K.l. and 'K.2. above, unless both parties 
agree that no replacement is necessary prior to the annual panel review.  

The northern list of arbitrators shall be used for arbitrations arising at the Davis, the Office of the 
President, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz locations, unless 
the parties agree to use an arbitrator from the southern panel.  The southern list of arbitrators shall be 
used for arbitrations arising at the Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Merced, Irvine, Riverside, and San 
Diego locations, unless the parties agree to use an arbitrator from the northern panel.  

 
 
The list of arbitrators is attached as Appendix _______. 
 
 

CATASTROPHIC/COMPASSIONATE LEAVE 

The University will implement local catastrophic leave programs for members of the Clerical and Allied 
Services unit where the location has indicated since 11/21/97 (or indicates by local notice) it intends to cover 
clerical unit employees in its program.  

 
2.   At every campus/hospital/Laboratory where a catastrophic leave sharing plan is currently in effect, the plan 

shall remain in effect for employees eligible under established campus/hospital/Laboratory guidelines.  
Clerical employees shall be eligible to participate fully in these plans as recipients and donors, consistent with 
local campus guidelines. 

The University agrees to implement a catastrophic leave program at all locations to cover at least all eligible 
clerical employees as defined by the local program by no later than February 1, 2000.  Eligibility for purposes 
of this article shall mean employees eligible to accrue or use vacation time.  When a location proposes to 
implement or to change the local catastrophic leave program with respect to clericals, it shall provide notice 
and upon written request from CUE, meet and discuss the proposal.  

CUE agrees that it will not demand to bargain further about catastrophic leave until bargaining has concluded 
on the first contract between the University and CUE and further bargaining begins according to the Duration 
Article.  

 
Memorandum of Understanding 
 
January 22, 1999 
 
CUE and the University agree that clerical employees shall be eligible immediately for full participation in operative 
Compassionate/Catastrophic Leave Sharing Programs at all locations consistent with the attached agreement and

A.  GENERAL PROVISIONS  
 

 
B.   TYPE OF DISCIPLINE  
 

1.  

The University shall have the authority to discipline or to dismiss a non-probationary career employee 
for just cause.  For purposes of illustration but not limitation, such actions may be taken for misconduct 
or failure to perform satisfactorily.  

2.   A non-probationary career employee who alleges that discipline and/or dismissal is not based on just 

cause may appeal such action pursuant to the provisions of Article - Grievance Procedure.  

1.  

The University may discipline an employee by written warning, suspension without pay, disciplinary 
demotion, salary decrease, or dismissal.  

2.   At least one written warning shall precede any other corrective action except when corrective action is 
the result of performance or conduct, that an employee knows or reasonably should have known, was 
unsatisfactory.  Such performance or conduct, may include, but is not limited to dishonesty, theft or 
misappropriation of University property, fighting on the job, insubordination, acts endangering others, or 
other serious misconduct.  

3.   A performance evaluation or a counseling memo is not in and of itself discipline.  

INVESTIGATORY LEAVE  

1.  

2.  

The University may place an employee on paid investigatory leave without prior notice in order to 
review or investigate allegations of employee misconduct which warrant relieving the employee 
immediately from all work duties and removing the employee from the premises.  

The investigatory leave must be confirmed in writing to the employee normally not later than three 
working days after the leave is effective.  The confirmation must include the reasons for and the 
expected duration of the leave.  

3.   On conclusion of the investigation, the employee shall be informed in writing of the disciplinary action, if 
any, to be taken.  If a disciplinary suspension is imposed, up to 15 work days of the investigatory leave 
may be converted to an unpaid disciplinary suspension provided the notice and employee responses 
provision of this Article have been followed before the final decision is made.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

 
The University and CUE agree the purpose of this Article is to encourage and facilitate the resolution of alleged 
violations, misinterpretations or misapplications of this Agreement as defined in A.1 below at the lowest level 
possible.  This preamble is not grievable or arbitrable.  
 
A.   GENERAL CONDITIONS  
 

1.   A grievance is a written complaint by an individual employee, a group of employees, or CUE that the 

University has violated a specific provision of this Agreement.  The University shall not have the right to 
use the grievance procedure.  

2.   No employee shall be subject to reprisal for using or participating in the grievance procedure of this 

Agreement.  

3. 

Filing  

a.   All grievances must be filed with the campus/hospital/laboratory Labor Relations office at the 

campus that employs the grievant and within the time frames specified in this Article.  Grievances 
must be filed on a form agreed to by the parties.  See appendix _______. 

b.   The grievance form must be signed and dated by the employee(s) or the employee's 

representative upon submission to the University.  Union grievances must be signed by the CUE 
President or designee(s).  

c.   The grievance form (see appendix -) shall be furnished to the employee by CUE and may be 

furnished by the University.  The University may provide employees with access to the form or 
direct the employee(s) to CUE.  

1)  

2)  

3)  

Only one incident shall be covered in any one grievance.  A formal grievance must identify 
the specific Article(s) and section(s) of this Agreement alleged to have been violated; 
describe the action(s) which allegedly violated the identified Article(s) and Section(s), 
together with the date(s) of the action(s); and describe the remedy requested.  

Receipt of the grievance shall be acknowledged in writing by the University as soon as 
practicable following receipt, and shall be sent to the non-work address listed on the 
grievance form.  

For the initial filing of a grievance, the date filed shall be the date received.  However, if the 
grievance is mailed, the date of the US Postal Service postmark shall be considered the 
date filed.  For grievance appeals and responses, the date of issuance shall be the date 
hand-delivered, or the date of the US Postal Service postmark, if mailed; provided the 
address used is the non-work address on the grievance form.  The date of hand delivery 
shall be the date of the stamp or handwritten acknowledgement of receipt as noted by the 
Labor Relations office.  

d.   No remedy shall exceed restoring to the grievant the pay, benefits or rights lost as a result of the 

violation of the contract, less any income earned from any other source including, but not limited to, 
workers' compensation, or any other employment.  

4.   Resolution of the grievance at any step, although final, shall not be precedent setting.  

 
B.   EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A grievant shall have the right to be represented at all steps of the grievance procedure by a CUE 
representative or a CUE-designated employee representative, or any other one person of the grievant's 
choice other than a University employee who has been designated as supervisory, managerial, or 
confidential.  CUE may have an additional advisor who shall not be a spokesperson and who shall not be on 
paid release time.  

 
C.   TIME LIMITS  
 

1.   Other than the time limits for the initial Step 1 filing of a grievance, the time limits as specified in this 
Article may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.  Extensions must be in writing and must 
be signed by the parties in advance.  The parties may mutually agree to skip any steps of the grievance 
procedure.  Such an agreement must be in writing and must be signed by the parties.  

2.   Deadlines that fall on a day that is not a regular business day will automatically be extended to the next 

business day.  

3.  

4.  

If a grievance is not appealed to the next step of the procedure within applicable time limits, and an 
extension has not been agreed to in advance, the grievance will be considered resolved on the basis of 
the last University response to the grievance and shall be considered ineligible for further appeal.  

If the University has not responded by the designated time limit in this Article, the grievance will be 
advanced to the next step in the grievance process if it is confirmed by CUE in writing by the deadline 
date for appeal to that step.  If CUE does not confirm the advance to the next step, the grievance shall 
be considered withdrawn and ineligible for further processing.  

D.  GRIEVANTS WHO HAVE RESIGNED  
 

Grievants who voluntarily resign their employment with the University, unless they retire, shall have their 
pending grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any subsequent settlement or disposition 
of any individual, union, or group grievance.  However, if the grievance is related to compensation negotiated 
in a UC/CUE Agreement, the grievance may be continued if it has moved to Step 2 before the date of 
resignation.  

 
E.   GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE - INFORMAL REVIEW 
 

Before commencing the formal grievance procedure, an individual employee, or group of employees, with or 
without their representative, may first attempt to resolve the alleged grievance informally.  When an employee 
or representative requests such a meeting, an Informal Review meeting shall be held with the immediate 
supervisor within 15 calendar days of the request.  Informal resolution of grievances at the lowest possible 
level is an objective shared by the University and CUE.  Informal attempts of settlement to resolve the 
grievance shall not extend time limits including the initial 30-day filing deadline.  

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE - FORMAL REVIEW  

1.   Step 1:  

a.   All grievances (individual, group, or union) must be filed either by U.S. mail or hand delivery, and 

received by the Labor Relations Office at the campus/hospital/Laboratory which employs the 
grievant(s) within 30 calendar days after the date on which the employee or CUE knew or could be 
expected to know of the event or action giving rise to the grievance.  If hand delivered after 
business hours, the date of receipt shall be the next business day.  

b.   Grievances received after the filing deadline will be processed solely for the purposes of 

determining whether the grievance was untimely.  

c.   Resolution of Grievances at the lowest possible level is an objective shared by the University and 

CUE.  If no Informal Review meeting took place, and either party requests it, there shall be a 
meeting held at Step 1 that includes the supervisor and the grievant.  

d.   University Review:  

1)  

The University's written response will be issued to the grievant and the representative, if 
any, within 15 calendar days after the meeting is held or, if no meeting is held, 15 days 
after the formal grievance is filed.  If the response is not issued within this time limit, the 
grievance shall be processed in accordance with C.4 above.  If the grievance is not 
resolved at Step 1, the grievance may be appealed to Step 2.  

 
e.   Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedures:  

1)  

An employee alleging sexual harassment may elect to substitute a 
campus/hospital/laboratory Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure for Step 1 
of the Grievance Procedure.  An employee who elects to use the Sexual Harassment 
Complaint Resolution Procedure may return to the grievance procedure only if they filed a 
grievance within the 30-day time limit for filing.  An employee who elects to resume the 
regular grievance procedure in place of the Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution 
Procedure shall do so by sending written notice to the University.  The University's Step 1 
Grievance response will be issued within 15 calendar days after the notice is received by 
the designated University official.  

2)  

Grievances that allege a violation involving sexual harassment may, at the grievant's 
option, enter the grievance procedure at Step 2.  

2.   Step 2  

 
F.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a.   If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the grievant or the Union may proceed to Step 2 by filing 

a written appeal with the Labor Relations Office within 15 calendar days of the date the written 
response is issued.  

b.   Unless the parties agree otherwise, the designated University local official shall convene a meeting 
with the grievant(s) and the grievant's representative, if any, to attempt to resolve the grievance.  
The meeting shall be convened no later than 15 calendar days following receipt of the appeal to 
Step 2.  During the Step 2 meeting, the parties shall discuss information and contentions relative to 
the grievance.  

c.   During the Step 2 process, the parties may agree in writing to amend the alleged violations stated 

in the original grievance.  

d. 

If requested by the grievant, a second CUE representative may participate in the Step 2 meeting.  
In the event a second CUE representative attends, only one representative may actively participate 
in the grievance meeting, and the University shall pay release time for only one representative.  

e.   If a grievance that alleges a violation of Article ___ - Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal 

only is not satisfactorily resolved at Step 2, CUE may appeal directly to arbitration in accordance 
with Article ___ - Arbitration Procedure.  

 
f.   A written decision shall be issued within 15 calendar days following the Step 2 meeting, or receipt 
of the Step 2 appeal if it is agreed that no meeting will be held.  If the University does not respond 
within the time limit, the procedures in C.4 will apply.  

3.   Step 3  

a.   All grievances that are not satisfactorily resolved at Step 2 may be appealed to Step 3.  The appeal 
must be filed with the Director of Labor Relations in the Office of the President within 15 calendar 
days of the date the University's Step 2 written answer was issued.  If the University has not issued 
its written decision to the Step 2 appeal by the deadline, the grievance shall be advanced to Step 3 
if it is confirmed by CUE in writing by the deadline to appeal to Step 3.  If CUE does not confirm the 
advance to the next step, the grievance shall be considered withdrawn and ineligible for further 
processing.  

b.   The Step 3 appeal shall identify all unresolved issues, alleged violations proposed remedies and 
shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) or their representative.  The subject of the grievance 
as stated at Step 2 shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter of the appeal to Step 3.  

c.   The Director of Labor Relations or designee shall issue the University's written answer to a Step 3 

appeal within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the appeal.  The answer will be issued to the 
grievant when self-represented, or to the employee's representative.  

 
G.   UNION GRIEVANCES  
 

 
H.   GROUP GRIEVANCE  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CUE shall have the right to present grievances under this procedure on behalf of an individual employee, on 
behalf of a group of employees, or on behalf of itself.  It shall be the Union's responsibility to inform an 
employee that it is bringing a grievance.  

A group grievance is defined as a grievance that covers more than one employee, and that involves like 
circumstances and facts.  A group grievance must be so identified on the grievance form at Step 1.  If an 
employee wishes to withdraw from a group grievance represented by CUE, the employee shall notify CUE.  
CUE shall in turn notify the University in writing if the employee is to be withdrawn.  

CONSOLIDATION OF GRIEVANCES  

I.  
 

Grievances of two or more employees, as well as multiple grievances by or related to the same employee, or 
which relate to the same incident, issue, alleged violation, facts, or course of conduct, may be consolidated.  
Consolidation or severance of grievances shall occur by mutual, written agreement of the parties.  

Settlement offers made during attempts at informal resolution or during the steps of the Grievance Procedure 
shall not be introduced as evidence in subsequent steps of the Procedure.  

 
J.   OFFERS OF SETTLEMENT  
 

 
K.   RETROACTIVITY  
 

Settlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as equities of a particular case may demand.  In any 
case where it is determined that the settlement shall be applied retroactively, except for the correction of an 
error in implementation in payment of wages, or the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or 
accounting errors relating to the payment of wages, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall not in 
any case be made retroactive to a date earlier than 30 calendar days prior to the initiation of the written 
grievance in Step 1.  For grievances involving the correction of an error in implementation in payment of 
wages, or the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment 
of wages shall not be made retroactive to a date earlier than three years prior to the initiation of the written 
grievance in Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure.  

 
L.   EXCLUSIVE PROCEDURE  
 

The Grievance Procedure set out in this Article shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance 
procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the alleged violation of this Agreement.  Unless 
otherwise indicated within this Agreement, any previous grievance procedure or other procedure in existence 
or adopted by the University shall not apply to employees covered by this Agreement for any purposes 
whatsoever.  

 
M.   RELEASE TIME AND PAY STATUS FOR GRIEVANT’S, EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES AND/OR 

WITNESSES  

 

 

 

 

1.   University-Convened Meetings  

a.   If the University convenes a meeting involving the parties to a grievance for the purposes of 

resolving the grievance and/or completing the steps of the Grievance Procedure, the grievant(s), 
witness(es), if any, and CUE-designated employee representative(s) eligible to attend such 
meeting pursuant to this Article and Article 1 - Access/Union Rights, ' C. shall be in 
without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status during the meeting, provided:  

1)  

 
2)  

3)  

such meeting occurs during the regularly scheduled hours of work of the grievant(s), 
CUE-designated employee representative, and/or witness(es); and  

advance request is made and approval is received from the supervisor of the grievant(s), 
the witness(es), and/or the CUE-designated employee representative.  Approval to attend 
shall be made on an operational needs basis and shall not be unreasonably denied.  

A grievant or the representative may request the availability of bargaining unit employee 
witnesses for University-convened grievance meetings.  The availability of bargaining unit 
employee witnesses shall be determined by their immediate supervisor(s) on the basis of 
operational needs, and such requests shall not be denied unreasonably.  Witnesses shall 
be in a without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status only for time spent at the 
campus/hospital/laboratory meetings as a witness and reasonable travel time spent at the 
witness' respective campus/hospital/laboratory location.  In instances where the witness' 
testimony is valuable and relevant to a grievant's case, paid release time for travel and 
testimony will not be unreasonably denied.  Grievants and CUE agree that every effort 

shall be made to provide witnesses that pertain solely to the subject matter and to avoid 
the presentation of repetitive witnesses and that the absence of any or all witnesses shall 
not require the meeting to be recessed or postponed.  

b.   The University is not responsible for any travel or lodging expenses or any other expenses incurred 

by the representative, grievant or union witnesses.  

c.   Paid release time for CUE designated employee representatives for purposes other than University 

convened meetings shall be provided in accordance with Article 1 - Access/Union Rights.  

 
N.   EXCLUSION OF CASUAL EMPLOYEES AND PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES  
 

The retention or release of casual employees and probationary employees (or temporary employees at 
LBNL) is at the sole discretion of the University, and shall not be subject to Article - Grievance Procedure or 
Article-- Arbitration Procedure of this Agreement.  

For Informational Purposes Only:  

When an action is taken by the University with respect to a casual employee which effectively terminates the 
casual employee during the term of his/her casual appointment and there are unique or unusual 
circumstances involved, the designated campus or Laboratory official, upon the specific request of the CUE 
president or designee will discuss the action taken.  It is understood that such requests for discussion will 
occur on a very limited basis and will not be made with respect to actions including but not limited to those 
resulting from the expiration of appointment, programs or grant funds, or the decision not to continue, rehire 
or extend the employment of a casual employee.  It is further understood that the opportunity for such 
discussion in very limited circumstances does not in any way confer upon a casual employee any property or 
process right and does not in any way obligate or commit a designated campus/Laboratory official to any 
specific course of action or procedure.  

 
O.   OTHER REPRESENTATION  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Grievants may choose a representative other than an CUE representative for purposes of grievance 
representation and adjustment.  In the event the University is involved in the resolution of a grievance from a 
grievant or group of grievants who are self-represented or represented by someone other than an CUE 
representative:  

1.  

The University shall provide CUE with a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution, indicating 
the grievant or grievants have chosen a representative other than CUE.  

2.   CUE shall have 10 calendar days from the date the University provides the material referenced above 

in which to comment in writing on the proposed resolution.  

3.  

4.  

The University shall not implement the proposed settlement or resolution of the grievance until timely 
receipt and review of CUE's written comments, if any.  

The resolution of grievances presented by someone other than a CUE representative shall be 
consistent with the terms of this Agreement.  

 
P.   GRIEVANCE FILE  
 
  

Records involving the processing of an employee's grievance, such as the grievance form, step 
appeals/responses, and settlement documents, will be kept in a file separate from the employee's personnel 
file.  It is not the intent of this section to exclude from the employee's personnel file final disciplinary action 
documents, including those that result from a settlement agreement.  The University will keep grievance files 
confidential to the extent required by applicable law and will not disseminate their contents unless solicited for 
a legitimate University business purpose or obligated to provide for a pertinent regulation or law.

subsequent occasion shall be grievable and arbitrable.  

2.   An employee may file a written indication of preference for a particular shift (i.e., day, evening, night) 

with her/his immediate supervisor.  When assigning work schedules and shifts to employees, the 
University will also consider the skills, knowledge, and abilities of the employees who normally perform 
the work involved prior to deciding upon the shift assignment.  In the event two (2) department career 
employees with substantially equal qualifications have expressed a preference, the University may use 
departmental seniority to make the shift assignment.  

3.  

The University may, at its sole non-grievable discretion, grant employee requests for flexible working 
hours, or shift assignments.

F.   REST PERIODS  
 

1.  

A meal period of at least one-half (1/2) hour is provided for any work period of six (6) continuous hours or 
more.  Meal periods are neither time worked nor time on pay status.  Whenever an employee is required to 
perform work or is not substantially relieved of work-related duties during a meal period, the meal period shall 
be considered time worked.  The University may reschedule an employee's meal period during the work day 
when operational needs preclude relieving the employee of work-related duties during the originally 
scheduled meal period, however, regularly scheduled meal periods shall normally be provided.  

Two rest periods of fifteen (15) minutes shall normally be granted during an eight (8) or ten (10) hour 
shift.  Three rest periods of fifteen (15) minutes shall normally be granted during a twelve (12) hour 
shift.  A part time employee shall normally be granted one fifteen (15) minute rest period for each work 
period of three (3) continuous hours or more, not to exceed two (2) rest periods per day.  

2.   Operational requirements may restrict the granting of rest breaks.  

3.   Rest periods shall not be taken at the beginning or end of a work period or accumulated for use at a 

later time.  The combining of rest periods with meal periods for some, any or all employees of a 
department/division shall be at the discretion of the University.  

1.  

Travel time between home and the work place is not time worked.  

2.   Assigned travel during an employee's regular working hours on work days is time worked.  

3.   Assigned travel that keeps an employee away from home overnight and that occurs outside the 

employee's normal working hours is not considered as hours of work.  However, assigned travel that 
does not keep an employee away from home overnight is considered as hours worked, as is travel that 
occurs during the hours an employee normally works when the travel occurs on the employee's days 
off.  

4.  

The department head may designate other travel as time worked.  

CALL-BACK  

1.   Call-back applies to an employee who is not in on-call status and is called back to the campus to work 
in her/his department after completing a shift and leaving the campus but before her/his next scheduled 
shift.  

2.   An employee called back to the work site may be assigned by the University to perform available work, 

and shall be paid for the time actually worked upon return to the campus/hospital/laboratory, or a 
minimum of three (3) hours, whichever is greater.  Call-back time, whether worked or not, is considered 
time worked for the purpose of calculating hours of overtime.  

 
J.   ON-CALL  
 
 

The University retains the right to determine the need for, and the assignment of, on-call time.  An employee 
is not considered to be in on-call status unless s/he has previously been scheduled by the University for the 
assignment.  Employees in on-call status are required to inform the employer how they can be reached or to 

 
G.   CHANGING AND CLEAN UP TIME  
 
 

 
H.   TRAVEL TIME  
 

The University shall determine when clean-up time or uniform changing time is necessary for employees.

carry a pager in order to receive a call to work.  An employee in on-call status is not eligible for minimum 
call-back payments.  An employee in on-call status who is called to perform work or to return to the work site 
will be paid at her/his regular rate of pay for the time worked.  Payment for on-call time paid at the on-call rate 
is included as part of compensation in calculating the regular rate when determining premium overtime pay.  

1.   Unrestricted on-call is time during which an employee is free to engage in activities for their own 

purposes but is required to be available for work or timely return to the work site when called to work.  
Time in unrestricted on-call status is not counted as hours worked or time on regular pay status when 
employees are not required to be at the work location or to actually perform work from a location other 
than the work location.  Unrestricted on-call will be compensated at the on- call rate, as listed in

K.   OVERTIME  
 

1.   DEFINITION  

Overtime is time worked which exceeds the hours of a full-time employee's regular daily schedule on pay 
status or exceeds forty (40) hours on pay status in a workweek.  

a.   Pay status includes time worked and paid leave such as sick leave, vacation leave, holidays, 

military leave, compensatory time off and administrative leave with pay.  

b.   Overtime hours are compensated at one and one-halftimes (1 1/2X) the straight-time rate only 

when an employee has actually worked in excess of forty (40) hours in the scheduled workweek.  

c.   Overtime hours do not count toward accumulation of sick, leave, vacation, holiday, or retirement 

service credit.  

d.   Actual time worked for the purpose of computing overtime does not include hours paid in non- work 

status, such as sick leave pay, vacation pay, holiday pay, compensatory time, and paid leave of 
absence pursuant to Article __, Leaves of Absence, except as provided in Article __, Holidays, 
Section C.2.  

2.   ASSIGNMENT OF OVERTIME  

a.   The University shall decide when overtime is needed.  Overtime must be approved in advance by 

the University.  As soon as practicable after the need for overtime is determined, the University 
shall notify the employee that overtime must be worked.  Employees are expected to work overtime 
when such work is assigned.  

b.   The University will assign overtime work by rotation based on departmental seniority of those 

employees on the same shift who normally perform the work involved.  For purposes of this Article, 
rotation means that the last employee to work overtime will be the last considered for new overtime 
assignments.  For the purposes of this Article, departmental seniority may be defined by each 
department at the campus/hospital/laboratory.  Such seniority is applied in the following manner:  

1.  

2.  

 

When there are employees volunteering to work the overtime, assignment of that overtime 
shall be based on greatest seniority, provided the employee(s) have the required skills, 
knowledge and ability to do the job.  

When no employee volunteers to work the overtime, assignment of that overtime shall be 
based on inverse order of seniority, provided the least senior employee has the skills, 
knowledge and ability necessary to perform the job.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

c.   The University shall assign overtime to employees irrespective of their place on the seniority or 

rotation list(s) when the necessary skills, knowledge or abilities are not possessed by the employee 
who would otherwise be assigned in accordance with the above provisions.  

3.   COMPENSATION OF OVERTIME  

 

In accordance with the following paragraphs, overtime shall be compensated at the appropriate rate 
either by pay or compensatory time off, if the department offers compensatory time off.  

a.   Unless the employee and the University agree otherwise, overtime will be paid.  An employee may, 

upon hire and thereafter during the month of June, file a written indication of preference for either 
compensatory time off or pay with her/his immediate supervisor.  The University shall grant the 
preference indicated.  

b.   Compensatory time shall be paid or scheduled by the University in accordance with departmental 

needs.  Accumulation of compensatory time is limited to a maximum of two hundred forty (240) 
hours.  An employee shall be paid for hours of overtime which exceed this limit.  An employee may 
request to schedule the use of banked compensatory time.  An employee's request for the 
scheduling of banked compensatory time shall be granted subject to the needs of the University 
and shall not be unreasonably denied.  

c.   Overtime shall be reported and paid on the basis of the nearest quarter (1/4) hour.  

1.  

Designated hospital-based eight (8) hour employees who are assigned to a fourteen (14) 
consecutive day work period,  

a.  

b.  

shall be compensated at one and one-half times (1 1/2x)the regular-straight time 
rate for hours worked which exceed eight (8) hours of actual work in any work day 
within the fourteen (14) day work period, and  

shall receive the time and one-half (1 1/2x) overtime rate after eighty (80) hours of 
actual work in the fourteen (14)day period.  

 

Any payment at the time and one-half (1 1/2x) rate for daily overtime hours worked within 
the fourteen (14) day work period shall be credited toward any time and one-half (1 1/2x) 
compensation due for hours worked in excess of eighty (80) hours of actual work in the 
work period.  

 
M.   GENERAL PROVISIONS  
 

 
L.   CONSECUTIVE DAYS OF WORK  
 

1.   Employees will be paid one and one-half times (1 1/2x) their straight-time rate in the following 

circumstances, until a day off is granted:  

 

 

 

 

2.  

a.   when employees regularly scheduled to work eight (8) hours per day work more than six (6) 

continuous full shifts for more than six (6) consecutive days;  

b.   when employees regularly scheduled to work ten (10) hours per day work more than five (5) 

continuous full shifts for more than five (5) consecutive days; and  

c.   when employees regularly scheduled to work, twelve(12) hours per day work more than four (4) 

continuous full shifts for more than four (4) consecutive days.  

The consecutive days of work provisions may be waived by the employee, either at her/his request or 
as the result of a scheduling change requested by the employee that results in such consecutive days 
of work.  

1.  

2.

LAYOFF AND REDUCTION IN TIME 

 

 

 
 

  

 

 

 
A.   DETERMINATION  
 

 
B.   DEFINITIONS  
 

The University shall determine when temporary or indefinite layoffs or reductions in time are necessary.  This 
determination is non-grievable and non-arbitrable.  

1.   A layoff is an involuntary separation from employment or an involuntary transfer to a casual position of 

a career employee.  For the purposes of this Article, layoff shall include involuntary reductions in 
regularly scheduled hours of work.  Layoffs may be temporary or indefinite.  

2.   A temporary layoff is a layoff in which the University specifies a date for return to work of not more than 

four months.  

3.   An indefinite layoff is a layoff for which no date for return to work is specified, or no date of restoration 

to the former appointment rate is specified.  

4.  

For the purposes of this Article, seniority shall be calculated by full-time-equivalent months (or hours) of 
University service.  Employment prior to a break in service shall not be counted.  When employees 
have the same number of full-time-equivalent months (or hours), the employee with the most recent 
date of appointment is the "junior" employee.  

 
C.   SELECTION FOR LAYOFF  
 

1.  

If, in the judgment of the University, budgetary or operational considerations make it necessary to 
curtail operations, reorganize, reduce the hours of the workforce and/or reduce the workforce, staffing 

 
D.   NOTICE  
 

levels will be reduced in accordance with this Article.  The selection of classes for layoff shall be at the 
determination of the University.  

2.   With regard to indefinite layoff only, the order of indefinite layoff of employees in the same class within 
a layoff unit shall be in inverse order of seniority, except that the University may retain, at its discretion, 
employees irrespective of seniority who possess special skills, knowledge, or abilities which are not 
possessed by other employees in the same class and which are necessary to perform the ongoing 
function of the department/division.  

3.  

The department head shall select employees for layoff, but shall minimize indefinite layoffs from career 
positions by first reviewing the necessity for existing casual and casual/restricted positions within the 
department.  

1.   When the University determines that a layoff is imminent within the unit, it shall give CUE such advance 

notice as is reasonable under the circumstances.  The notice shall describe the general areas which 
may be affected.  

2.   When the University selects particular members of the unit for layoff, it shall give individual notice to 

each employee of the effective date of the layoff and whether the layoff is temporary or indefinite.  
Advance notice will be provided as follows:  

a.   For temporary layoff expected to last 120 calendar days or less, the University shall give, if 
feasible, 15 calendar days notice of the expected beginning and ending dates of the layoff.  

b.   For indefinite layoff, the University shall give 60 calendar days notice, if feasible.  The University 
may pay up to 30days of the 60-day notice period in lieu of notice.  In no event shall an employee 
receive less than 30 days' notice of indefinite layoff.  For conversion from temporary layoff to 
indefinite layoff, the University shall give 30 calendar days' notice, if feasible.  

c.   In the event of an anticipated indefinite layoff of five or more full-time equivalent (FTE) employees 
on the same effective date in the same layoff unit, the University will, to the extent possible, give 45 
calendar days notice to CUE.  When such notice is provided regarding the layoff of five or more 
FTE, the campus/hospital/laboratory will, upon receipt of a timely written request from CUE, meet 
with CUE to discuss the layoff.  

3.  

The University shall notify CUE at the same time it notifies employees that they are to be laid off.  

4.   When the University determines that there is to be a change in a layoff unit within the bargaining unit, it 
shall give CUE advance notice of at least 30 days, if feasible, and upon request shall meet and discuss 
such proposed changes.  Changes to a layoff unit shall not occur more frequently than each 120 
calendar days.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
E.   PREFERENTIAL REHIRE  
 

1.   A non-probationary career employee who is indefinitely laid off shall have preferential rehire status for 
an active vacant career position.  An active career position is a position which the University, in its sole 
discretion, determines to fill. Such employees are rehired provided: 

a.   the active, vacant career position is in the same bargaining unit and at the same 

campus/hospital/laboratory as the position from which the employee was laid off; and  

b.   the active, vacant career position is in a class with the same or lower salary range maximum as the 

class from which the employee was laid off; and  

c.   the active, vacant career position is at the same or lesser percentage of time as the position from 

which the employee was laid off.  

2.   Employees who are eligible for preferential rehire status with less than five years of seniority at the time 

the layoff occurs shall retain preferential rehire status eligibility for one year.  Employees who are 
eligible for preferential rehire status with five years, but less than 10 years seniority at the time the 
layoff occurs shall retain preferential rehire status eligibility for two years.  Employees who are eligible 
for preferential rehire status with 10 years or more seniority shall retain preferential rehire status 
eligibility for three years.  

3.   An employee may exercise his or her rights to preferential rehire immediately after the employee 

receives written notification of layoff and meets with the campus representative designated in the layoff 
notice.  

4.   Employees preferentially rehired from layoff status who fail to perform satisfactorily may, at any time 

during the six months following such return, be returned to layoff status with restoration of full 
preferential rehire status.  In addition, an employee, at his or her option, may request to be returned to 
layoff status within 60 calendar days of rehire.  The time on job status will not be counted as part of 
preferential rehire eligibility time.  

5.   Preferential Rehire Termination 

The preferential consideration described above shall terminate at the end of the period of eligibility 

described in ' E.2. above, or if an employee:  

a.   refuses an offer to return, at the same or greater percentage of time, to that department/division 

and class from which laid off; or  

 
b.   accepts any career position; or  
 
c.   refuses two offers of employment for a career position at the same or higher salary level and the 

same percentage of time as the position held by the employee at the time of layoff; or  

d.   fails to respond to a written notice of a career employment opportunity within 15 calendar days. 
The15-calendar day response period shall begin immediately upon personal notice of the career 
employment opportunity or 10 calendar days from the date written notice is postmarked.  

6.  

If an employee voluntarily reduces his or her time for a reason listed in ' C.l. above., within one year 
prior to a layoff, the employee is entitled to recall/rehire rights at a percentage of time equal to that from 
which the employee voluntarily reduced his or her time.  The request for the voluntary reduction must 
be submitted by the employee in writing and approved by the supervisor and must state the effective 
date and the percentage of the reduction in time.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
F.   RECALL  
 

1.   A non-probationary career employee who is indefinitely laid off shall be recalled in order of seniority to 

an active, vacant career position, provided:  

a.   The active, vacant career position is in the same class and department at the same or lesser 

percentage of time as the position from which the employee was laid off.  

b.   The employee is qualified to perform the duties of the active, vacant career position.  

2.   Employees who are eligible for recall shall retain recall eligibility for three years from the date of layoff.  

3.   Employees recalled from layoff status to a new position who fail to perform satisfactorily may, at any 

time during the six months following such return, be returned to layoff status with restoration of full 
recall rights.  The time on job status will not be counted as part of recall eligibility time.  

 
G.   SEVERANCE  
 

4.   Recall Termination  

The right to recall terminates at the end of the period of eligibility or if an employee:  

a.   refuses a recall to work; or  

b.   refuses two offers of reemployment in career positions at the same or greater percentage of time 

and at the same or higher salary level; or  

c.   accepts a career position at the same or higher salary level within the University.  

1.   A career employee who has received a notice of indefinite layoff may, at the sole non-grievable 

discretion of the University, be offered severance pay in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights.  
Each campus department shall, in each instance of layoff where severance pay is offered, exercise the 
option of offering severance in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights to all employees in the 
department affected by the layoff.  Severance pay shall be in accordance with the following.  

a.   Employees with less than five years of service receive two weeks or 10 workdays of severance.  

b.   Employees with five or more years of service receive five weeks or 25 workday's severance, plus 

one-week severance for each additional full year of service up to a maximum of 15 weeks' 
severance.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
I.  
 

 
J.  
 

2.   CUE will be notified if an employee has been offered severance rather than recall/preferential rehire.  

Should an employee be returned to work as a result of a grievance, arbitration, or settlement 
agreement related to the layoff, any severance pay received will be deducted from the back pay award.  
An employee cannot be returned to work without first repaying the severance or signing a severance 
repayment agreement.  

 
H.   CONTINUITY OF SERVICE UPON REEMPLOYMENT  
 

1.   A temporary layoff does not create a break in service.  Reemployment in a career position within the 
period of right to recall provides continuity of service and continuation of previously accrued seniority 
and, therefore, no break in service.  However, seniority and benefits accrue only when an employee is 
on pay status.  

2.   An employee who has been laid off and is rehired at another University location within the employee's 

period of recall will be eligible for the following as result of no break in service:  

a.   reinstatement of all sick leave accumulated from prior service,  

b.   reinstatement of vacation accrual rate,  

c.   calculation of University service based on full-time equivalent months (or hours) of University 

service, and  

 
d.   buy-back of UCRP service credit according to the University Benefit Regulations

reduced work schedule, and if so, the probable duration of such schedule, and,  

if the condition is chronic and the employee is presently incapacitated, the duration and 
frequency of episodes of incapacity.

discretion, require an employee requesting leave to care for a family member with a serious health 
condition or requesting Parental leave, to provide documentation of the familial relationship or proof 
of birth, placement for adoption or in foster care.  The employee's failure to provide documentation 
within fifteen (15) calendar days of the University's request may, at the sole non-grievable 
discretion of the University, result in either

employee's certification for her/his own serious health condition the University may, at its sole 
non-grievable discretion, require the employee to obtain a second medical opinion from a second 
health care provider selected by the University.  Should the second medical opinion differ from the 
opinion of the employee's own health care provider, the University may, at its sole non-grievable 
discretion, require a third medical opinion from a third health care provider, jointly agreed to by the 
employee and the University.  The University shall bear the cost of the second and third opinions, 
and the third opinion shall be final.

may result in discontinuance of the leave until the required certification is provided.  If the 
employee fails to provide certification, the leave is not Family Care/Medical Leave and will 
be denied as family care leave, in accordance with the provisions of ' B.4.c.2).  

f.   FAILURE TO PROVIDE COMPLETE CERTIFICATION AND/OR RECERTIFICATION.  If the 

employee fails to provide a completed certification and/or recertification, the employee shall be 
given at least fifteen (15) calendar days to perfect the certification and/or recertification.  Failure to 
perfect an incomplete certification and/or recertification within the requested time period may result

shall temporarily transfer a pregnant employee to a less strenuous or hazardous position upon the 
request of the employee and with the advice of the employee's health care provider, if the transfer can

designated by CUE an amount representing the authorized dues deductions, fair share service fees and 
other designated deductions.  Accompanying the check shall be a standard deduction report which shall 
contain by campus/hospital/Laboratory, an alphabetical listing of the CUE members and fee payers for whom 
payroll deductions were made.  The report shall include the employee identification number, employee name,

If the University fails to make authorized deductions of union dues, fair share service fees or other authorized 
deductions or any part thereof, or fails to remit to CUE such authorized deductions or any portion thereof, or 
erroneously withholds deductions or any part thereof, the University shall correct the errors.  The University 
shall refund to CUE any deductions it has erroneously failed to remit.  From the time CUE notifies the 
University in writing of any such errors, or if the University becomes aware of such errors, the University shall 
have 45 days to make the corrections.  If after 45 days the University does not make the agreed-upon 
corrections and CUE incurs direct costs, the University will reimburse CUE for reasonable, documented costs 
incurred to make corrections for only University errors.  If there is not agreement on the correction or the 
costs, CUE may grieve the matter only as a union grievance.  

It is expressly understood and agreed that CUE shall refund to the employee any deductions erroneously 
withheld from the employee's wages by the University and paid to CUE.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 

1.   Performance Evaluation is a constructive process to acknowledge the performance of an employee.  

An employee's evaluation shall be sufficiently specific to inform and guide the employee in the 
performance of her/his duties.  Performance standards are guidelines for performing the duties of a 
specific job.  Performance standards and guidelines for performing the duties of a specific job shall be 
reasonable.  The evaluation of each employee shall be based on the individual employee's 
performance.  

2.   Except in the case of minor and non-substantive changes, the University will, 60 calendar days prior to 

implementing anew performance evaluation form or written performance standard, provide a copy of 
the proposed form or written standard to CUE.  If CUE provides a written request to meet and discuss 
within 30 days of the notice date, the University shall meet and discuss with CUE regarding the 
change.  In addition, if CUE requests in writing to meet about any alleged significant change in 
performance standards or performance evaluation form.  The University shall meet and discuss within 
30 days of CUE's request regarding the change, if any.  

3.   Performance evaluation is not in and of itself a disciplinary procedure.  

4. 

5.  

Clerical Unit employees who receive an overall "needs improvement" rating shall have been informed 
of any deficiencies, including information about how to correct said deficiencies prior to receiving such 
overall evaluation.  

The performance of each non-probationary career employee shall be evaluated at least annually, in 
accordance with a process established by the University.  In the event anon-probationary career 
employee does not receive the written evaluation, the employee may take the following action:  

a)   Within 15 calendar days of the date the written evaluation was due but not received, the 

employee shall make a written request for the evaluation to the employee's immediate 
supervisor.  When an employee makes such a request, an evaluation shall be completed within 
15 calendar days of the request, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.  

b)  

In the event a non-probationary career employee does not receive a written evaluation and fails 
to request that an evaluation be completed within the required period of time, the employee's 
overall evaluation shall be "meets expectations."  

 
B.   EMPLOYEE RESPONSE TO AN EVALUATION  

 

After receiving a University performance evaluation, an employee may write comments pertaining to her/his 
evaluation or add relevant materials, which may supplement or enhance the evaluation.  When the University 
receives such written comments or materials from the employee, they shall be attached to the performance 
evaluation and placed in the employee's personnel file in which performance evaluations are maintained.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
C.   GRIEVABILITY  
 

1.   A non-probationary career employee who receives a written performance evaluation with an overall 
rating of less than satisfactory may file a grievance pursuant to the provisions of Article - Grievance 
Procedure of this Agreement.  Such grievance concerning the content of a performance evaluation 
rating the employee as less than satisfactory shall be eligible to be processed through Steps 1and 2 of 
the Grievance Procedure, but shall not be eligible for review at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure.  
The remedy for such a grievance shall be limited to revision of the section(s) being grieved and revision 
of the rating(s) in question.

employee's personnel file(s) if there have been no other disciplinary actions of the same or of a 
similar kind for a period not to exceed two years.  Materials which would be removed upon an 
employee's request which are more than two (2) years old will not be used or relied upon to take 
or support disciplinary action.  If there have been no other disciplinary actions of the same or 
similar kind for a two year period, materials which would be removed upon an employee's 
request which are more than two years old will not be used or relied upon to take or support 
disciplinary action.  The employee shall receive the written request and the documents back.

discussions will be removed from the employee's personnel file if there have been no other such 
memoranda relating to, or disciplinary action on, the same or similar issue(s) for a two-year 
period not to exceed two years.  Counseling memoranda and/or written records of discussion, in 
and of themselves, are not discipline nor are they grievable/arbitrable.

REHABILITATION/REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION 

 
A.   When appropriate, the University will provide special assistance to employees covered by this Agreement 
who become disabled when such disabilities substantially limit their work activities.  This assistance shall 
include attempts to achieve reasonable accommodation, and for non-probationary career employees, special 
selection procedures upon request.  All employees shall be provided information about rehabilitation services.  

 
B.   After receipt of medical documentation from the employee, the University will determine what assistance, if 

any, will be offered to the employee.  Such documentation provided by the employee shall be subject to 
confirmation by a University-appointed physician.  The University shall pay the cost of a University-appointed 
physician.  

 
C.   A non-probationary career employee who becomes disabled and who has received vocational rehabilitation 

services may be selected for a position without the requirement that the position be publicized when

D.   REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION  
 

1.  

The University shall analyze the position held at the onset of an employee's illness or injury, if such a 
position is still available.  Such analysis shall identify the essential functions of the position and 
conditions of the work environment to aid in determining if reasonable accommodations can be made 
to the employee's disability.  If necessary, a similar accommodation analysis shall be conducted of 
other open unit positions for which the employee may apply and is otherwise qualified.  

The employee is responsible for providing medical documentation to assist in understanding the nature 
of any required accommodation to a disability.  Such documentation shall relate specifically to the job 
analysis information provided by the University and shall, at the University's option, be subject to 
confirmation by a University-appointed physician.  The University shall pay the cost of a 
University-appointed physician.  

 

2.  

 
E.   TRIAL EMPLOYMENT  
 
 

When recommended by a vocational rehabilitation counselor and approved by the appropriate University 
official, a qualified former non-probationary career disabled employee may be offered temporary trial 
employment to evaluate the employee's interests and abilities.  The length of this trial employment, which 
shall not exceed one year, shall be determined by the counselor in consultation with the employing 
Department/Division Head.  Positions used for trial employment shall not be designated as career, except 
that an employee shall maintain benefits to the extent permitted by benefit plan rules.

rescinding of the resignation except by the written mutual agreement of the University and the 
employee.  

3.

appropriate payroll-related papers in the payroll department, but no later than forty-five (45) calendar 
days following the employee's resignation.  The paperwork initiating the resigned employee's final 
paycheck shall be initiated as soon as practicable following her/his resignation.  Retirement 
compensation shall be provided pursuant to retirement plan regulations.  

JOB ABANDONMENT

an employee's job abandonment resulting in her/his resignation:  

1.  

2.  

3.  

In the case of job abandonment, the University shall provide the employee with written notification of its 
intent to separate her/him.  This notification shall include the reasons for the separation, the employee's 
right to respond to the University within fourteen (14) calendar days, and a Proof of Service.  The 
notification shall be sent to the employee's last known mailing address.  

The employee shall have fourteen (14) calendar days from the mailing of such notice to respond to the 
University prior to her/his separation.  The response may, at the option of the employee, be in writing or 
may be a meeting with a designated University official.  The official must have the authority to 
effectively recommend reinstatement of the employee.  

Following the employee's timely response, or if no response was provided within fourteen (14) calendar 
days, the decision of the designated University official is not subject to the grievance and/or arbitration 
provisions of this Agreement.

political expression and/or freedom of speech; nor shall anything in this Article impede normal expression in 
labor-management communications.  A Universitywide Labor/Management meeting shall develop an 
understanding of application of the above stated limitations for purposes of this Article, in addition to 
developing the meaning of "dignity and respect" for purposes of this Article.

SEVERABILITY 

In the event that any provision of this Agreement is declared invalid or void by statute or judicial decision, 
such action shall not invalidate the entire Agreement.  It is the express intention of the parties that all other 
provisions not declared invalid or void shall remain in full force and effect.  In the event that any provision of 
this Agreement is declared invalid or void, the parties agree to meet promptly upon request of the other party 
in an attempt to reach an agreement on a substitute provision.  

SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL 

 
A.   Eligible employees assigned to an evening or night shift shall be paid a shift differential for all hours including 
overtime which are worked.  Classes eligible for a shift differential and shift differential rates by location are 
listed in Appendix A.  Work which is scheduled during the evening or night hours on the basis of convenience 
to the employee shall not be considered an assigned evening or night shift for the purpose of this provision.  

B.   Shift differential shall be paid for all hours of a shift when four hours or more of a shift are worked after 

5:00p.m. and before 8:00 a.m.  

 
C.   An employee in an eligible class regularly assigned to a day shift of eight hours or longer shall be paid a shift 
differential for overtime hours when the overtime hours are worked after 5:00 p.m. and before 8:00 a.m., the 
total overtime hours in one 24-hour day are equal to at least one-half of the number of regular hours in the 
employee's day shift, and the overtime is not compensated at a premium rate.  

 
D.   When an employee who usually works on an evening or night shift is temporarily assigned to a day shift for a 
period of four working days or less, the employee shall continue to receive any shift differential.  A temporary 
change of four working days or less in shift assignment initiated by the employee is not covered by this 
provision.  

 
E.   The shift differential shall be included in payments for all types of paid leave, provided that the employee 

would have been expected to work that shift or shifts if the employee were not on paid leave.  

 
F.   Prior to assigning a shift differential rate to a classification that does not have an established rate, the 

University and CUE must negotiate the shift differential rate to be assigned to that classification.  

 
SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL -- LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABORATORY  
 
Policies, procedures, definitions, qualifications, calculations, covered hours and rates relative to Shift Differential at 
the Laboratory shall remain in effect for employees at the Laboratory and shall supersede the provisions of this 
Article in A. through E. above.  Shift differential rates for employees at the Laboratory are listed in Appendix B.  
 
Addendum:  
 
The University will increase the minimum shift differential to 37 cents per hour, effective October 1, 1999.

10%.  No per diem employee will have their rate reduced as a result of this adjustment.  
 
 

 
A.   ACCUMULATION OF SICK LEAVE CREDIT  
 

SICK LEAVE 

1.  

If a campus implements the Factor Accrual System, an eligible employee shall earn sick leave credit at 
the rate of 0.046154 hours per hour on pay status, including paid holiday hours but excluding all paid 
overtime hours.  

2.  

If a campus uses the Table Accrual System, an eligible employee shall earn sick leave credit at the rate 
of eight hours per month for full-time employment.  Sick leave credit is earned proportionately, as set 
forth in the Sick Leave Credit Table below, for hours on pay status over one-half of the full-time working 
hours of the month but less than full-time.  

3.   Until a campus provides notice to CUE of a proposed change to either the Table Accrual System or the 

Factor Accrual System, current accrual practices will remain in place.

4.   An employee must be on pay status for at least one-half of the working hours of a month or 

quadri-weekly cycle to earn sick leave credit for that month or quadri-weekly cycle.  Time on pay status 
in excess of a full-time work schedule does not earn sick leave credit.  Sick leave is earned during 
leave with pay.  For the purposes of this Agreement, a quadri-weekly cycle is defined as two bi-weekly 
pay periods designated by the University to be considered as one unit for the purpose of leave accrual.  

5.  

For employees on either system, earned sick leave for each month or quadri-weekly cycle is credited 
on the first day of the following month or quadri-weekly cycle, except that proportionate sick leave 
credit for an eligible employee who is separating from employment shall be credited at the completion 
of the last day on pay status.

denied.  

c.   Sick leave shall not be used prior to the time it is credited.  Sick leave shall not be used in excess 
of the employee's normally scheduled hours or work for the day or days for which the sick leave 
is claimed.  Sick leave shall not be used beyond a predetermined date of separation, including 
retirement or layoff, or beyond a predetermined date beginning a leave of absence without pay.  

2.   Pregnancy

normal duties of her job.  A pregnant employee may also be eligible for Pregnancy Disability Leave as 
provided in Article 14 - Leaves of Absence,'D.  

3.   Care of Others

grandparent, grandchildren, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, 
brother-in-law, sister-in-law, or step-relatives; or any other person for whom the employee has a 
personal obligation who is residing in the employee's household.  

b.  

In the event an employee has a personal obligation for a person other than someone in 'B.4.a. 
above, the employee shall be permitted to use up to five days of accrued sick leave per calendar 
year for funeral attendance/bereavement.  

5.  

Illness While on Vacation  

If, while on vacation, an employee becomes ill and is under the care of a physician and submits a 
physician's statement, the employee may use accumulated sick leave for that personal illness.  Sick 
leave may not be used for illness of a family member during the employees' vacation.  

 
C.   SICK LEAVE PAY  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sick leave is paid at the employee's straight-time rate of pay including any shift differential, provided that the 
employee would have been expected to work that shift or shifts if not on sick leave.  

 
D.   SICK LEAVE NOTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION  
 

1.   No sick leave pay shall be payable to an employee unless the employee's immediate supervisor or 

designee is notified of the illness/disability and the probable duration thereof as soon as possible, but in 
no event later than the beginning of the employee's work day except when the University determines 
that the employee's failure to notify is due to extreme circumstances beyond the control of the 
employee.  Subsequent to an employee's notice of illness/disability, no time for which the employee 
has requested and/or received sick leave authorization may be charged to accumulated/anticipated 
compensatory time, leave with pay, vacation, or holiday time, except as provided in Article 14 - Leaves 
of Absence.  

2.   Any employee who anticipates a series of three or more medical appointments which will require a 

repeated use of sick leave, or who knows in advance the date and/or time of scheduled appointments, 
shall inform his or her immediate supervisor of the anticipated or known schedule of treatment.  

3.  

The University may require reasonable documentation of an employee's sick leave absence when an 
absence exceeds three consecutive scheduled days of work, or for shorter periods when: 

a.  

it appears to be justified and,  

b.  

notice has been provided to the employee prior to his or her return to work, that documentation 
will be required, or  

c.  

the employee has been given advance written notice that documentation will be required.  

4.   Employees who have unscheduled absences due to illness on a scheduled work day preceding or 

following a holiday may be required to bring a medical verification of illness to the employee's 
supervisor on the employee's return to work in order for the absence to be authorized.  

5.   When medical documentation is required by the University, it shall be from a health practitioner 

licensed by the state in which he or she practices to diagnose and certify illness or disability or from an 
authorized representative of a recognized treatment program.  

6.  

The University may have an employee claiming disability examined by a physician or physicians of its 
choosing, in accordance with Article 14 - Leaves of Absence.  The University shall pay the reasonable 
costs of any such medical examination and, when practical, shall send the employee to a physician of 
its choosing on the employee's work time.  

7.   When the University has determined that an employee's repeated use of sick leave is abusive, and has 
given the employee prior written notice that accrued sick leave use may be denied on future instances 
of illness, such employee may be denied the ability to use his or her accrued sick leave when absent 
due to illness.

Laboratory.  

 
A.   DEFINITIONS  
 

TRANSFER/PROMOTION/RECLASSIFICATION 

1.   A transfer is the change of an employee from one position to another position which is in a class having 

the same salary range maximum.  

 
2.   A promotion is the change of an employee from one position to another position which is in a class 

having a higher salary range maximum.  

 
B.   TRANSFER/PROMOTION OF EMPLOYEES  
 

1.   Whenever it is determined by the University that a vacancy in a career position within the bargaining 

unit is to be filled at a campus/hospital/Laboratory, the following procedure will apply:  

a.   Notice will be posted according to local campus procedures, either in writing or electronically.  If 

all posting is accomplished through the computer system, at least one printed posting will be 
available at the local personnel office or where application information is available.  Unless the 
vacancy is restricted to internal candidates, it will be posted for at least 10 working days.  Where 
there are varying posting periods these varying posting practices shall remain and continue.  

b.   A vacant bargaining unit career position shall be filled in the following order:  

1)  

2)  

by recall of an indefinitely laid off non-probationary career employee in accordance with 
Section - of Article - Layoff and Reduction in Time of this Agreement;  

by preferential rehire of an indefinitely laid off non-probationary career employee in 
accordance with Section-. of Article - Layoff and Reduction in Time of this Agreement;  

 

c.  

d.  

e.  

3)  

by any other qualified applicant.  

If, in the evaluation of the department head, two or more applicants are substantially equally 
qualified, the department head shall make the determination taking into consideration Article _ , 
Sections B.1. and B.3. and the University will maintain its Federal contractor status.  The 
University shall give consideration to providing transfer and promotion opportunities for career 
employees.  In considering an employee for transfer and promotion, the University shall consider 
the employee's University work performance and experience.  In those cases where the 
department head determines that qualifications of an applicant who is currently a University 
employee and qualifications of an external candidate are essentially equal, the department head 
shall reconsider the credentials (including but not limited to the resume, application, a written 
recommendation from the employee's supervisor, and/or interview responses, if any) of the 
University employee applicant(s).  

In addition, the University shall consider qualified employees who are eligible for reemployment 
in accordance with SectionC. of Article - - Rehabilitation and Section - of Article _Medical 
Separation of this Agreement.

applicants for the vacancy to current University employees.  

2.   Employees who are scheduled for a job interview at the same location as the employee's current 

position shall be granted reasonable time off with pay, as determined by the University, if the interview 
has been scheduled during the employee's normal work hours.  An employee scheduled for an 
interview on another campus/hospital/Laboratory shall be granted reasonable time off with pay for an 
amount of time normally equal to the time that would be required for an interview on the employee's 
own campus/hospital/laboratory.

the new class or of one step in amount, whichever is greater, provided that the new rate does not 
exceed the maximum of the new class.  The University at its sole non-grievable discretion may, upon 
the promotion of an employee, determine that the employee should receive an increase of greater than 
one step in amount.  The University may exercise this sole non-grievable discretion on a 
location-by-location basis and on a promotion-by-promotion basis and on a non-precedential basis.  In 
those instances where such discretion is exercised the resultant individual rate of pay shall not exceed 
the maximum of the position salary range.  

4.  

The University shall provide CUE with information concerning the number and classifications of 
bargaining unit positions posted which were restricted to current University employees, and the number 
and classification of bargaining unit positions where an employee was promoted and received more 
than a one-step increase.  This information shall be made available annually for the period of April 1st 
through March 30th and provided to CUE during the month of May.  

5.  

In accordance with campus/hospital/Laboratory practice, the University shall inform employees of 
career development and/or training programs that might assist them with transfers and/or promotions.

7.   An employee may request a review of a decision denying a reclassification.  The request for a review 
shall be made in writing to the personnel department within 30 calendar days of the date on which the 
reclassification decision was issued.  The request shall state the basis upon which the employee is 
requesting a review.  The result of the review shall be issued in writing by a representative of the 
classification unit (personnel department at the Laboratory) other than the representative who issued 
the initial decision.  

8.   An employee whose position has been reclassified upward shall be granted a salary increase to the

below the maximum.  Normal vacation shall continue to accrue during the additional four-month period.  

 
G.   VACATION PAY  
 

1.   Pay for accumulated vacation shall be at the employee's straight-time rate, including any shift 

differential paid to employees permanently assigned to a shift which provides a differential.  

2.   An employee who separates from employment or who is granted extended military leave shall be paid 

for any accumulated vacation through the employee's last day of work, except that an employee who is 
retiring may use accumulated vacation up to the effective date of retirement.  

3.   An employee released during his or her probationary period shall be paid for accrued vacation time.  

 
H.   TRANSFER OF VACATION CREDIT  
 
 

An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted to another position at a University campus in which 
vacation credit can be accumulated shall have any accumulated vacation credit transferred, unless such 
transfer is in conflict with the terms covering the new position.  An employee who is transferred, promoted, or 
demoted to a position at a campus in which vacation credit does not accumulate shall be paid for any 
accumulated vacation at the time of transfer.  An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted to or 
from a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory position shall be paid for any accumulated vacation at the 
time of transfer.  

DONATIONS FOR CATASTROPHIC LEAVE  

Any Clerical and Allied Services Unit employee may participate in a campus/hospital/laboratory's 
Catastrophic Illness/Injury Leave program, in accordance with the provisions of that location's program and 
Article __ Catastrophic/Compassionate Leave.  

 
J.   CURTAILMENT PERIOD  
 

1.   Consistent with the University's management rights, including its right to determine the orderly, 
effective and efficient operation of the University, the University may elect at one or more of its 
locations including the Laboratory, to curtail or shut down some or all of its activities, on a 
location-by-location basis, for periods of specific duration.  By way of example and not limitation, such 
periods may represent opportunities for energy/cost savings and/or adjustments to reduce levels of 
work activity due to transition periods in the academic calendar and/or "seasonal" or "holiday" 
influences on scheduled work activities and/or the occurrence at or on University facilities of major 
public events and/or the occurrence of emergency or "forces of nature" situations adversely affecting 
normal University operations.  

 

 

 

 
I.  
 
 

2.  

In the event of such total or partial closure or curtailment of operations, whether or not the University is 
able to anticipate such event, employees affected shall select one or a combination of the following 
options to cover their status during such period of time:  

a.   Employees may use accumulated vacation leave during the period.  Newly employed unit members 

would be allowed to use accrued vacation even if the required six continuous months or 
quadri-weekly cycles on pay status have not been completed.  Employees without sufficient 
accumulated vacation would be allowed to use up to three days' vacation leave prior to actual 
accrual.  

b.   Employees with accrued compensatory time may elect to use it to cover the scheduled time off or 

to offset the use of vacation time.  

c.   Employees who do not wish to use vacation or compensatory time off may elect to take a leave 

without pay during the closure.  Notwithstanding the provisions of A.5. above, if an employee is in 
leave-without-pay status due to a location closure which is three consecutive days or less in 
duration, such a full-time or part-time employee shall not lose hourly vacation accruals.  

d.   Employees who do not select from a., b. or c. above or who do not qualify for a., b. or c. above 

shall, for the period of time necessary, be placed in a leave-without-pay status.  The hourly accrual 
provisions in E.2.c. above related to location closure(s) shall also apply to employees who are 
placed in leave-without-pay status.

WAIVER 

 
A.   The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the 

unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not 
removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and the understandings and agreements arrived at by 
the parties after the exercise of the right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement.  The rights and 
procedures granted and set forth under Staff Personnel Policy will no longer apply to employees covered by 
this Agreement.  The University and CUE, for the life of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly 
waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to 
any subject or matter referred to, or covered in this Agreement, or with respect to any subject or matter not 
specifically referred to or covered by this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have been 
within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed 
this Agreement.  

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
A.   GENERAL PROVISIONS  
 

WORK-INCURRED INJURY 

This Article defines the application of sick leave and vacation for employees who are unable to work due to a 
work-incurred injury or illness compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act, and provides 
extended sick leave benefits for such employees when sick leave is exhausted and employees are still 
unable to work because of such injury or illness.  

1.   An employee unable to perform the normal duties of his or her job due to a work-incurred illness or 
injury compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act shall be granted leave for the 
duration of a verified disability but not to exceed six months or a predetermined date of separation, 
whichever comes earlier.  The employee may request, in writing, an extension of the leave up to six 
months according to Article - Leaves of Absence, §B.  

2.   Work-incurred Injury or Illness Leave runs concurrently with Family Medical Leave.  

3.   An approved leave of absence for work-incurred illnesses or injuries shall not be considered a break in 

service.  

4.   Employees who are unable to work due to a work-incurred injury or illness compensable under the 

California Workers' Compensation Act are eligible to use accrued sick leave and vacation as provided 
below.  When sick leave is exhausted and when employees are still unable to work because of such 
illness or injury, employees may use extended sick leave or leave without pay as provided below.  

5.   An employee shall notify his or her supervisor of the need for leave for a work-incurred injury or illness, 

or any extension of such leave, as soon as practicable after the need for such leave or extension is 
known.  This notification shall include written medical certification of the need for such leave or 
extension, and the anticipated return to work date.  

 
B.   EXTENSIONS OF WORK-INCURRED INJURY OR ILLNESS LEAVE  
 

In the event an employee requires an extension to his or her work-incurred injury or illness leave, the 
employee shall provide the University with a statement from his or her licensed health care practitioner of the 
need for the extension and the anticipated return to work date.  

1.   Such a statement must be provided 10 calendar days prior to the date the employee was previously 

scheduled to return to work.  

2.  

In the event prior notice is not provided, the University will not pay extended sick leave to the employee 
for the period between the previously scheduled return date and the date the statement is received.  

 
C.   RETURN FROM WORK-INCURRED INJURY OR ILLNESS LEAVE  
 

1.   Prior to returning to work, an employee granted a work-incurred injury or illness leave must provide the 
University with a statement from his or her licensed healthcare practitioner of the employee's ability to 
return to work.  When possible, an employee granted a work-incurred injury or illness leave must 
provide the University with 10 calendar days notice of his or her ability to return to work.  If a return to 
work specifies restrictions, the University will consider what accommodation, if any, will reasonably be 
made.  

 
2.  

If the position held has been abolished during the leave, the employee shall be afforded the same 
considerations which would have been afforded had that employee been on pay status when the 
position was abolished.  

 
D.   SUPPLEMENTAL SICK LEAVE AND VACATION  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.   An employee who accrues sick leave and vacation shall be permitted to use accrued sick leave and 

vacation to supplement temporary disability payments received under the California Workers' 
Compensation Act.  

2.   Sick leave and vacation payments shall be the difference between the amount payable to the employee 

under the Workers' Compensation Act and the employee's regular salary.  The additional payment 
made to an employee to provide the employee with full salary prior to receipt of disability payments 
shall be deemed an advance temporary disability payment within the Workers' Compensation Act.  

3.   An employee who receives advance temporary disability payment shall reimburse the University for 

such payment.  The reimbursement is used to restore proportionate sick leave and vacation credit as 
appropriate.  

 
E.   EXTENDED SICK LEAVE  
 

1.   An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and who has exhausted all accrued sick 

leave shall receive extended sick leave payments from the University in an amount equal to the 

difference between the payments from Workers' Compensation and 80% of the basic salary plus any 
shift differential which the employee would have received. If such an employee returns to part-time 
University duties, the earnings plus any temporary disability payments, if less than 80% of basic salary 
plus shift differential, shall be supplemented to 80% by extended sick leave payments, provided the 
employee continues to be medically authorized for Workers' Compensation temporary disability.  Total 
extended sick leave payments shall not exceed 26 weeks for any one injury or illness.  

 
2.   An eligible employee who does not have sufficient accrued sick leave to cover the three calendar days' 

waiting period for receiving Workers' Compensation payments shall receive extended sick leave 
payment to cover any part of the waiting period not covered by sick leave.  Payment shall be made only 
after determination that the injury or illness is compensable under Workers' Compensation.  

3. 

An employee who elects not to use all sick leave is not eligible for extended sick leave benefits.  

 
F.   EFFECT ON PAY STATUS  
 

1.   Supplemental Leave  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
H.  
 

An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and supplemental sick leave or vacation 
as described in 'D. above is considered on regular pay status for purposes of application of provisions 
of this Agreement, except completion of the probationary period.  Sick leave and vacation accrued 
during this period may be used as soon as they accrue.  

2.    Extended Sick Leave  

An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and extended sick leave benefits as 
described in 'E. above is considered to be on regular pay status for purposes of application of 
provisions of this Agreement, except completion of the probationary period.  Sick leave and vacation 
accrued during this period is credited to the employee only upon return to work.  However, if an 
employee separates without returning to work, the employee shall be paid for vacation accrued during 
the period the employee received extended sick leave payment.  

3.  

Leave Without Pay  

An employee on leave without pay and receiving temporary disability payments accrues sick leave and 
vacation on the same basis as if regularly employed, but such accrual is credited to the employee only 
upon return to work.  If an employee separates without returning to work, no payment shall be made for 
such vacation credit.  

 
G.   SEPARATION  
 

An employee shall not use vacation, sick leave, or extended sick leave to supplement Workers' 
Compensation payments beyond a predetermined date of separation or leave without pay.  Any vacation 
credit remaining on the date of separation shall be paid on a lump-sum basis.  

LIGHT DUTY  

Subject to operational considerations and budgetary constraints, the University may, on a case-by-case 
basis, place an employee in a temporary assignment consistent with documented medical restrictions, 
when the employee has experienced work related injuries.  This section shall not be construed as a 
guarantee of a specific form of accommodation nor shall accommodation in one case establish a precedent 
for similar or dissimilar circumstances.
