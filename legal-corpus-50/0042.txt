SECTION 1    The CITY shall deduct regular monthly UNION dues from the pay 
of each employee covered by this Agreement, provided that at the time of 
such deduction there is in the possession of the Finance Department of the 
CITY a current unrevoked written assignment, executed by the employee, in 
the form and according to the terms of the authorization form attached 
hereto, marked Appendix "A", and made a part hereof.  Such authorization 
may be revoked by the employee at any time by giving written notice thereof 
to the Finance Department of the CITY. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    Previously signed and unrevoked written authorizations shall 
continue to be effective as to employees reinstated following layoff, leave 
of absence, or suspension not exceeding sixty (60) days; previous 
authorizations of other employees rehired or reinstated shall not be 
considered to be effective. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    Such authorized deductions shall be made from each payroll 
period and will within ten (10) days be remitted to the duly designated 
UNION official. The UNION shall advise the Finance Department of the CITY 
in writing of the name of such official. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    If an employee has no pay coming for the first payroll period 
of the calendar month, or if such pay period is the first pay period of a 
new employee, or if the employee has signed an authorization form during 
such pay period of the subsequent month, such deductions shall be limited 
to the amount of the current regular monthly UNION dues, and shall not 
include dues for prior months or any portion thereof. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    If the Finance Department of the CITY receives an employee 
revocation of authorization on or before the eighth day of the first 
payroll period of the calendar month, no deductions will be made from that 
payroll period or subsequent payroll periods.  If such revocation is 
received after the eighth day of the first payroll period, a deduction will 
be made from such payroll but shall not be made from subsequent payroll 
periods. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6    The UNION shall advise the Finance Department of the CITY in 
writing of the exact amount of regular monthly UNION dues.  If, 
subsequently, the UNION requests the Finance Department of the CITY to

that additional amounts are regular monthly UNION dues duly approved in 
accordance with the UNION'S constitution and by-laws. 
 
 

 
SECTION 7    The CITY shall not be liable for the remittance of any sums 
other than those constituting actual deductions made; and if for any reason 
the CITY fails to make a deduction for any employee as above provided, it 
shall make that deduction from the employee's next pay period in which 
UNION dues are normally deducted after written notification to the Finance 
Department of the CITY of the error.  If the CITY makes an overpayment to 
the UNION, the CITY will deduct that amount from the next remittance to the 
UNION.  The UNION agrees to indemnify and hold the CITY harmless against 
any and all claims, suits, orders or judgments brought or issued against 
the CITY as a result of any action taken or not taken by the CITY under the 
provisions of this Article.

STRIKES 
 
 
 
The UNION shall neither cause nor counsel any person to hinder, delay, 
limit, or suspend the continuity or efficiency of any CITY function, 
operation, or service for any reason, nor shall it in any manner coerce, 
intimidate, instigate, induce, sanction, suggest, conspire with, promote, 
support, sponsor, engage in, condone, or encourage any person to 
participate in any strike, slowdown, mass resignation, mass absenteeism, or 
any other type of consorted work stoppage.  The UNION shall not aid or 
assist any persons or parties engaging in the above prohibited conduct by 
giving direction or guidance to such activities and conduct, or by 
providing funds, financial, and other assistance for the payment of strike, 
unemployment, or other benefits to those persons or parties participating 
in such prohibited conduct and activities; provided, however, that the 
UNION may provide legal representation.  In applying the provisions of this 
Article, all of the terms used herein shall be given the meaning commonly 
understood.  The UNION shall not be in breach of this Agreement where the 
acts or actions hereinbefore enumerated are not caused or authorized 
directly by the UNION. 
 
 
 
Upon notification confirmed in writing by the CITY to the UNION that 
certain of its members are engaged in a wildcat strike, the UNION shall 
immediately in writing order such members to return to work at once, and 
provide the CITY with a copy of such an order, and a responsible official 
of the UNION shall publicly order them to return to work.  Such 
characterization of the strike by the CITY shall not establish the nature 
of the strike.  Such notification by the UNION shall not constitute an 
admission by it that a wildcat strike is in progress or has taken place or 
that any particular member is or has engaged in a wildcat strike. The 
notification shall be made solely on the representations of the CITY.  In 
the event that a wildcat strike occurs, the UNION agrees to take all 
reasonable, effective and affirmative action to secure the members' return 
to work as promptly as possible. 
 
 
 
The CITY agrees that it shall not lock out any employees because of a labor 
dispute.

SECTION 2    DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS-REPRIMAND:  Any employee may be 
reprimanded for cause.  Such reprimand shall be in writing and signed by 

the employee.  A copy of the reprimand document shall be transmitted to the 
employee. The original shall be transmitted to the Personnel Department for 
inclusion in the employee's personnel file. 
 
 
 
An employee may request that any reprimand that is greater than one year 
old be removed from his personnel file.  This one year period begins when 
the reprimand is actually transmitted to the employee. The employee will be 
provided with the originals of such documents. No copies or notations of 
such documents will be maintained in the personnel file.  A copy of such 
document will be maintained in a separate, generic, file in the Personnel 
Department.  Such file shall be maintained under no individual employee’s 
name but simply under the heading “Removed Disciplinary Actions”.  Such 
documentation may be used only for purposes of litigation not relating to 
the employee’s discipline; or in appeals, arbitration or litigation 
relating to the employee’s discipline only for the purposes of impeachment. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS-SUSPENSIONS:  An employee may be 
suspended without pay for cause for a period or periods not exceeding forty 
(40) working days in any twelve (12) consecutive months, however, no single 
suspension shall be for more than twenty (20) working days.  Such 
suspension shall be in writing and acknowledged in writing by the 
employee.  The suspension shall include the reasons for and the duration of 
the suspension.  The original or a copy of the suspension document shall be 
transmitted to the employee.  A copy of this shall be transmitted to the 
Personnel Department for inclusion in the employee’s personnel file. 
 
 
 
                        An employee may request that any suspension that is 
greater than five (5) years old be removed from his personnel file. The 
above 5 year time period shall begin when the notice of the suspension is 
actually transmitted to the employee. The employee will be provided with 
the original such documents.  No copies or notations of such suspension 
shall be maintained in the employee’s personnel file.  A copy of such 
document will be maintained in a separate, generic file in the Personnel 
Department.  Such file shall be maintained under no individual employee’s 
name but simply under the heading “Removed Disciplinary Actions”. Such 
documentation may be used only for purposes of litigation not relating to 
the officer’s discipline; or in appeals, arbitration or litigation relating 
to the officer’s discipline only for the purposes of impeachment. 
 
 
 
An employee, at his option, shall have the right to exchange annual leave 
for suspension days if such suspension is for five (5) working days (40 
hours) or fewer.  Such exchange shall be made on a one-for-one ratio (up to 
the five working day limit).  Such exchange may also be made for unappealed 
suspensions of more than five (5) working days (40 hours). 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS-DEMOTION:  An employee may be demoted for 
cause.  A written statement of the reasons for any such action shall be 

transmitted to the employee and a copy transmitted to the Personnel 
Department for inclusion in the employee’s personnel file.  No demotion 
shall be made as a disciplinary action unless the employee to be demoted is 
eligible for employment in a lower class and shall not be made if any 
regular employee in a lower class will be laid off by reason of the action. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS-DISCHARGE: An employee may be discharged 
for cause.  Prior to the discharge becoming effective a written statement 
containing the reasons for the discharge shall be transmitted to the 
employee and to the Personnel Department for inclusion in the employee’s 
personnel file.  The CITY  may suspend such employee immediately and 
indefinitely with pay.  Prior to the discharge becoming effective such 
employee shall be entitled to present his side of the facts surrounding the 
discharge to an impartial CITY decision maker. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6    Any disciplinary action must be initiated within forty-five 
(45) working days of the incident occasioning the disciplinary action. 
This time limitation shall not apply whenever the disciplinary action 
results from or is the product of a criminal investigation.  An extension 
on the time period may be granted when mutually agreed upon by the Labor 
Relations Director and the UNION. 
 
 
 
When a citizen's complaint is not sustained for any reason (exonerated, not 
sustained, or unfounded) at the Departmental level, no disciplinary action 
will be taken against the employee unless the citizen appeals for further 
review within ten (10) working days of being notified that the complaint 
has not been sustained at the Departmental level.  However, an extension on 
the time period may be granted when mutually agreed to by the Labor 
Relations Director and the UNION.  This time limitation shall not apply 
whenever the disciplinary action results from or is the product of a 
criminal investigation. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7    An accused officer shall be informed of the nature of the 
investigation and shall receive a written notice of the charges being 
investigated against such officer at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to 
the formal interrogation by the Police Department.  This twenty-four (24) 
hour period may be waived if the complaint alleges intoxication or drug 
incapacitation during on duty status.  The written notice shall contain the 
following information:  (1) the allegations of the complaint; (2) the time 
and date and location of the incident giving rise to the investigation, if 
known; (3) if the complaint is a written document from an anonymous source, 
such written document shall be provided to the employee.  If there exists a 
written complaint from a City employee (sworn or non-sworn), such document 
shall not be provided to the accused employee. 
 
 
 
In the event that the procedures set forth above are not followed, the 
charges against the officer will be dismissed without prejudice. 

 
 
 
SECTION 8    The CITY agrees to maintain in its Personnel Department a list 
of all disciplinary actions against all bargaining unit employees. 
Disciplinary action shall be defined as all written reprimands, demotions, 
suspensions and discharges.  The list, to be kept current on a weekly 
basis, shall denominate employee and type of action taken against the 
employee, and shall be accessible to authorized UNION representatives only.

SECTION 1    Any employee who has satisfactorily completed twelve (12) 
months of employment with the CITY shall have the right to appeal to either 
the Personnel Board or arbitration, but not both, from a suspension, 
termination of employment, or reduction in classification or pay not later 
than ten (10) working days after receiving notice of such action.  Any such 
employee who receives a written reprimand shall have the right to appeal to 
the Personnel Board only not later than ten (10) working days after 
receiving notice of such action.  There shall be no right of appeal from 
the Personnel Board to the arbitrator or from the arbitrator to the 
Personnel Board. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    If an election is made to appeal to the Personnel Board the 
appeal must be in writing setting forth the reasons why such action is 
improper and submitted to the Personnel Director within the ten (10) 
working day time period. The Personnel Director shall cause such appeal to 
be placed on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled Personnel Board 
meeting, provided the appeal is received at least ten (10) working days 
prior to the regularly scheduled Personnel Board meeting. Otherwise it 
shall be placed on the agenda of the Personnel Board for the next regularly 
scheduled meeting. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    The Personnel Board or arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction 
to terminate employment of an employee upon an appeal from a suspension. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    If an employee, serving a probationary period by virtue of 
promotion, is terminated from employment for cause, he shall be entitled to 

file and process an appeal under the provisions of Section 1 or Section 2 
hereof. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    If an election is made to appeal to arbitration, the procedure 
for selection of the arbitrator shall be as set forth in Article 8, Step 3, 
second paragraph, of this Agreement. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6    An employee shall have the right to process an appeal 
individually, by the UNION, and/or by an Attorney at Law.  If an employee 
elects not to use the UNION or its attorney in the processing of an appeal, 
the decision of the Personnel Board shall not set binding precedent on the 
UNION. 
 
 
 
                                                                    ARTICLE

                                                     GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    “Grievance” as defined in this Agreement is a claim of an 
employee arising during the term of this Agreement which is limited to 
matters of interpretation or application of the express provisions of this 
Agreement and excluding discharge and disciplinary actions as provided in 
Article 6 hereof, which actions shall be processed in accordance with 
Appeal Procedure as set forth in Article 7 of this Agreement.  The UNION 
shall have the right to file a grievance in accordance with Article 8. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    The following procedure shall be used in the submission of a 
grievance, as defined in Section 1 hereof. 
 
 
 
Step 1.      An employee or UNION who has a grievance shall present the 
same, in writing, to the Police Chief, or his designated representative, 
within ten (10) working days from the date on which the employee or UNION 
became aware of the grievance. The written grievance must set forth the 
sections and articles of this Agreement upon which the matter of 
interpretation or application is involved.  The Police Chief, or his 
designated representative, shall respond to the grievant in writing within 
ten (10) working days from the date on which the written grievance was 
received. 
 
 
 
Step 2.      In the event the employee or UNION is dissatisfied with the 
response of the Chief, or his designated representative, then the employee 

or UNION may, within ten (10) working days from the date of the response 
given by the Police Chief, or his designated representative appeal said 
decision, in writing to the CITY Labor Relations Director, or his 
designated representative.  The Labor Relations Director or his designated 
representative shall respond to the grievant, in writing, within ten (10) 
working days from the date on which the grievance appeal was received.  An 
extension on the time period may be granted when mutually agreed to by the 
Labor Relations Director and the UNION. 
 
 
 
Step 3.      If satisfactory settlement is not reached under Step 2 hereof, 
either the aggrieved employee, the UNION or the CITY by and through the 
Labor Relations Director, or his representative shall, within twenty (20) 
working days from the expiration of the limits as set forth in Step 3 or 
any extension thereof as set forth in Section 3, by written notice to the 
other party, request arbitration.  The CITY shall furnish the UNION with a 
copy of any such notice sent or received requesting arbitration. 
 
 
 
The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted by an arbitrator to be 
mutually selected by the parties within thirty (30) calendar days after the 
submission of written demand for arbitration.  The UNION shall at its 
discretion become a party for the purpose of selecting an arbitrator.  The 
UNION and the grievant shall together be considered one party. If the 
parties are unable to mutually agree as to the selection of an arbitrator 
within such time limit and either party continues to demand arbitration, 
the parties shall jointly request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation 
Service to provide a list of five (5) arbitrators.  [PJM1] Each party shall 
have the right to strike two (2) names from the list of arbitrators as 
submitted.  The party requesting arbitration shall have the right to strike 
the first name and the other party shall then strike one name with the same 
process being repeated so that the person remaining on the list shall be 
the arbitrator. 
 
 
 
There shall be no appeal from the arbitrator's decision.  It shall be final 
and binding on the UNION, if the UNION is a party to the arbitration, the 
CITY, and on all bargaining unit employees who take part in or are 
represented in the arbitration proceeding.  Where an employee elects to 
process a grievance without UNION representation or assistance, the UNION 
shall have the right after the arbitrator has been selected to intervene 
and become a party to the proceeding. 
 
 
 
Authority of the arbitrator is defined and limited by Article 7 and Article 
8 of this Agreement.  In the event the arbitrator finds that he has no 
authority or power to rule in the case, the matter shall be referred back 
to the parties without decision or recommendation on the merits of the 
case.  The arbitrator shall be requested by the parties to issue his 
decision within thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the 
hearing. 
 
 

 
Parties selecting the arbitrator shall share equally the arbitrator's 
expenses.  Each party shall be responsible for compensating its own 
representatives and witnesses.  If a party desires that a record of the 
testimony be made at the proceedings it may cause such a record to be made 
at its expense; provided, however, that it supplies the arbitrator and 
other party or parties with copies of such record at no expense to the 
other party or parties. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    Any time limitation provided herein may be waived or extended 
in writing by mutual agreement of the aggrieved employee or the UNION and 
the Labor Relations Director or his designated representative.  If either 
party fails to comply with any time limitation or extension thereof, absent 
written waiver of same, the grievance shall automatically be resolved in 
favor of the other party. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    An aggrieved employee shall have the right to process his 
grievance individually, by the UNION, and/or by an attorney at law.

            COMPLAINT PROCEDURE 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    A “Complaint” as defined in this Agreement means any 
suggestions or disagreements by an employee or his UNION representative 
concerning the terms or conditions of his employment.  A complaint does not 
include matters of discharge and discipline or grievances as defined in 
Section 1 of Article 8. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    The employee or his UNION representative shall have the right 
to discuss a complaint with the Police Chief or his designated 
representative only after having first exhausted the procedures of the 
Department for the processing of complaints without satisfactory 
resolution.  The decision of the Police Chief or his designated 
representative shall be final and binding and not subject to review or 
appeal by the Personnel Board or any court of law.

SENIORITY 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    Seniority shall be based on continuous length of service in 
classification covered by this Agreement without a break or interruption; 
provided, that any suspension for disciplinary purposes as provided in 
Section  3 of Article 6, absence on authorized leave with pay, absence on 
authorized leave without pay; or lay-off for thirty (30) calendar days or 
less, shall not constitute a break or interruption of service within the 
meaning of this Section. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    Seniority shall commence from the date an employee enters a 
classification covered by this Agreement. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    A list of employees arranged in order of seniority by 
classification and a list of employees arranged in total service with the 
Omaha Police Department shall be maintained and made available for 
examination by employees. The seniority list shall be revised and updated 
at the end of each fiscal year and a copy of the same shall be transmitted 
to the UNION.  The list of employees arranged in total service with the 
Omaha Police Department shall be maintained and provided for information 
only. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    Where two or more employees in the same classification were 
appointed on the same date, their seniority standing shall be determined in 
the order of their ranking on the eligibility list from which their 
eligibility for appointment was determined. 
 
 
 
                                                                   ARTICLE

                                                  PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    The probationary period of an employee shall consist of two 
(2) years of actual employment except in a case of a promotion which period 
shall consist of six (6) months from the effective date of promotion.  Any 
interruption of employment during either probationary period shall not be 
counted as part of the period.  Approved leave does not constitute an 
interruption of employment;  however, approved leave in excess of thirty 
(30) days shall extend the employee's probationary period by a like number 
of days.  An employee rehired after termination of previous employment 
shall be hired as a probationary employee and such probationary period 
shall consist of six (6) months of actual employment within the meaning of 
this Article and prior service shall not be credited to such period of 

time. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    An employee who is transferred to another position in the same 
or different class in the same department prior to the completion of his 
probationary period shall complete that service period in the latter 
position by adding thereto his service in the former position. 
Verification of satisfactory employment in the new position by the Police 
Chief will be deemed to constitute verification of satisfactory service 
also in the original position.  The provisions of this Section will not 
apply in any case of transfer from one department to another. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    At any time during the probationary period the Police Chief 
may remove an employee whose performance does not meet the required 
standards, provided that he shall report the removal and reasons therefor 
in writing to the Personnel Director and to the employee concerned.  Any 
employee removed from a position during the first  twelve (12) months of 
the probationary period (provided, however, the CITY may unilaterally 
extend this period an additional six months upon giving notice to the 
employee and the UNION of the reasons for such extension) or during the six 
(6) months of a promotional probationary period, except where otherwise 
provided in Section 4 of Article 7 shall not be entitled to appeal such 
removal or have the same reviewed by an arbitrator or Personnel Board.  An 
employee removed from his position after completion of twelve (12) months 
service shall have the right of appeal to the Police Chief, Personnel 
Board, or an arbitrator. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    At any time during the probationary period when an employee is 
about to be laid off because of reduction in force, the Police Chief, with 
the consent of the employee, may demote such employee, in lieu of lay-off 
if he is otherwise eligible and work is available in a lower class.  The 
name of such employee shall be restored to the lists from which it was 
removed at time of appointment.  The probationary period of an employee 
demoted in lieu of lay-off during that period shall include the period of 
probation in the higher class.  No demotion of this kind shall be made if 
it will result in the separation of any other employees with greater length 
of service.  An employee serving as a result of appointment from a 
promotional list, who is removed from the new position for reasons other 
than misconduct or delinquency and who was a regular employee in another 
position in the classified service immediately prior to his promotional 
appointment, shall be reinstated in his former position or one of like 
status and pay. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    At least seven (7) working days prior to the expiration of an 
employee's probationary period, the Police Chief shall notify the Personnel 
Director in writing whether the services of the employee have been 
satisfactory and whether the employee will be continued in his position.  A 
copy of this notice shall be given to the employee by the Police Chief. 
Upon receipt by the Personnel Director of a favorable report, the 
appointment of the employee shall be made a regular employee at the 

expiration of the probationary period.  In the absence of such a favorable 
report, the employee shall be terminated from employment. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6    All probationary employees will conform to the semi-annual 
detail change seniority bid process at the completion of the first eighteen 
(18) months of employment.  Promotional probationary employees will be 
assigned according to their seniority within that rank in compliance with 
Article 15, Section 6. 
 
 
 
                                                                   ARTICLE

LAY-OFFS 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    Whenever a reduction in work force becomes necessary because 
of a lay off, lay-offs shall be made on the basis of seniority in 
classification.  For purpose of this Article only, for an employee who has 
at anytime previously invoked the privileges accorded by Section 3 of this 
Article, seniority-in-classification shall mean total service as an 
employee of the Police Department of the CITY in all classifications above 
or equal to the rank to which the employee is assigned.  In all other 
instances seniority-in-classification shall mean the numbered years 
employed in his particular classification as set out in Article 10. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    No regular employee shall be laid off from any classification 
while there are provisional, probationary, part-time, or seasonal employees 
working in the same classification. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    In the event an employee becomes subject to lay-off in his 
classification, and is qualified to perform duties in a lower 
classification, he shall be permitted to take a position in the next lower 
classification at that classification's rate of pay, and any employees in 
the lower classification subjected to lay-off by virtue of the provisions 
of this Section, shall be laid off in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 1 hereof. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    In the event that an employee becomes subject to lay-off in 
his particular classification and a vacancy exists in a position of lower 
classification for which he is qualified, he may, with the approval of the 
Personnel Director, or his designated representative, be appointed to such 
position in a lower classification on the basis of his seniority. 
 

 
 
SECTION 5    The names of regular employees who have been laid off shall be 
placed on a recall from lay-off list, maintained by the Personnel 
Department, and shall be eligible for recall from layoff for a period of 
five (5) years, and the CITY shall rehire in the reverse order of lay-off; 
provided, such employees are otherwise qualified to perform the duties of 
the position. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6    Where an employee has accepted a position in a lower 
classification by virtue of Section 3 or 4 hereof, he shall be recalled to 
his former position when the same becomes available in the reverse order of 
reduction. 
 
 
 
                                                                   ARTICLE

                                                           LEAVE PROVISIONS 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    SICK LEAVE WITH PAY:  Sick leave shall be earned at the rate 
of five and one-half (5½) hours per pay period (143 hours per payroll year) 
and unused sick leave may not be accumulated in excess of three thousand 
two hundred (3,200) hours.  This change takes effect upon the execution of 
this Agreement.  Any current employee employed on or before January 29, 
1998, who initially reaches 800 hours of accumulated sick leave shall 
automatically be credited with 200 hours of additional sick leave.  This 
credit is a one time only bonus.  Should the employee subsequently use sick 
leave so as to fall below 1,000 hours, he must then earn back any used 
hours.  Persons who begin employment as police officers after January 29, 
1998,shall not be credited with this 200 hours of additional sick leave. 
Employees may with the approval of the Police Chief utilize their 
allowances of sick leave when unable to perform their work duties by reason 
of illness or injury, necessity for medical or dental care, exposure to 
contagious disease under circumstances in which the health of other 
employees or the public would be endangered by attendance on duty or for 
reasons related to the employee’s pregnancy; or her adoption of a child (up 
to a maximum of 400 hours).  Employees shall advise their supervisors 
immediately when it is necessary to be absent from work on account of 
sickness due to reasons listed above.  The CITY may request documentation 
of the medical necessity, and the employee must provide such documentation 
for the employee’s absence from work. 
 
 
 
Employees shall keep their supervisors currently informed of their 
condition.  Failure to fulfill these requirements may result in the denial 
of sick leave.  Department Heads shall be responsible for verifying and 
administering sick leave within their respective departments.  The Police 
Chief may require either a certificate of a physician stating that such 

illness or injury prevented the employee from working, or a medical 
examination by a physician designated by the Personnel Director or his 
designated representative.  Sick leave shall not accrue during any period 
of absence without pay in excess of five (5) working days per payroll 
period. 
 
 
 
An employee upon retirement from the CITY service; or death; or resignation 
after 20 years of CITY service, (except in cases where the employee has 
been guilty of fraud or other activities resulting in a  monetary loss to 
the CITY), shall be entitled to be paid straight time pay at the at the 
employee’s pay schedule of three (3) hours for every eight (8) hours of 
accumulated sick leave to a maximum of 2,000 hours.  This will increase to 
a maximum of 3,200 hours after December 22, 2001.  This benefit will not 
apply to employees upon resignation or termination with less than 20 years 
of CITY service. 
 
 
 
Employees may utilize forty (40) hours of sick leave in a payroll year for 
illness or injury to immediate family members.  "Immediate" family member 
is defined as those family members covered by the Federal Family Medical 
Leave Act. 
 
 
 
Employees shall be entitled to a credit for annual leave at the rate of two 
(2) hours per pay period, to a maximum of fifty two (52) hours in a payroll 
year conditioned on meeting the following: 
 
 
 
The employee must: 
 
 
 
1.         Have a sick leave balance of 1,000 hours, or more; and 
 
 
 
2.         Have, in the immediate past payroll year, used 40 hours or less 
of sick leave. 
 
 
 
The above bonus for annual leave shall operate as follows:  At the end of 
each payroll year, each employee who has met the above criteria shall 
receive the bonus for the entire ensuing payroll year pursuant to the 
credit schedule above, irrespective of whether that individual employee 
goes below that criteria during that ensuing year.  If an employee does not 
meet that criteria on the final day of the payroll year, he/she shall not 
receive the bonus for the entire ensuing year irrespective of the fact that 
at some time during that ensuing year such employee may meet the above 
requirements.  In other words, the concept is that the bonus is granted for 
a payroll year based upon the employee’s sick leave usage in the prior 
year. 

 
 
 
When an employee initially reaches 1,000 hours of accumulated sick leave, 
he shall receive the above bonus for the remainder of the year in which he 
reached the 1,000 hour mark irrespective of any usage for the prior payroll 
year.  At the end of that payroll year, he shall be evaluated according to 
the criteria set forth above. 
 
 
 
All hours of sick leave shall be counted against an employee's balances for 
the purpose of accumulation of gross numbers of sick leave.  However, any 
sick leave usage used by an employee for her pregnancy, (up to but not 
exceeding 400 hours per pregnancy) shall not be counted only for the 
purpose of determining whether she qualifies for the annual leave bonus. 
 
 
 
If sick leave is used by an employee for a single illness during the 
payroll year change period (December - January) mandating two years without 
bonus instead of one, the employee may request an exemption.  This 
exemption will be applied at the sole discretion of the Labor Relations 
Director. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    ANNUAL LEAVE:  Effective with the passage and legal execution 
of this Agreement, Annual leave shall be earned by employees with less than 
five (5) years of continuous service with the CITY at the rate of four and 
six tenths (4.6) hours per pay period (119.6 hours per payroll year) and 
for such employees with five (5) years or more of continuous service with 
the CITY at the rate of six and one-half (6½) hours per pay period (169 
hours per payroll year); provided, however, that annual leave for such 
employees in excess of 320 hours shall not be carried forward from one 
payroll year to the next payroll year, except where an employee is not 
permitted to take annual leave during the year by virtue of being on 
Injured on Duty status. 
 
 
 
Employees shall be provided with the opportunity to take annual leave in 
minimum increments of one (1) hour and the CITY shall have the exclusive 
right to determine the means, methods and systems by which annual leave is 
scheduled; provided, however, that employees shall have the right to select 
their annual period in the unit as prescribed by the Police Chief by virtue 
of their seniority as defined in Article 10. 
 
 
 
Any employee serving a probationary period of six (6) months by virtue of a 
promotion shall be entitled to take annual leave in accordance with the 
provisions of this Section; all other probationary employees shall not have 
the right to use annual leave for the first twelve (12) months of 
employment in accordance with the provisions of this Section, but may at 
the sole discretion of the Police Chief, or his designated representative, 
be granted the opportunity to use annual leave for emergency purposes.  The 

decision of the Police Chief, or his designated representative, in this 
regard is final and binding and not subject to the grievance procedure. 
 
 
 
ANNUAL LEAVE PROCEDURES 
 
 
 
1.                  Block Annual Leave is annual and/or holiday leave in 
which the employee will be absent from duty a minimum of six (6) 
consecutive days.  Normal Block Annual Leave and Summer Block Annual Leave 
must be requested in writing.  Block Annual Leave, whether Summer Block 
Annual Leave or Normal Block annual leave, will prevail over “per diem” 
annual leave. 
 
 
 
2.                  Summer Block Annual Leave is annual and/or holiday 
leave taken in the months of May, June, July and/or August.  Requests for 
Summer Block Annual Leave shall be delivered by the employee to the shift 
commander on or before April 1st of each year.  In granting Summer Block 
Annual Leave, seniority will prevail.  If an employee submits more than one 
request, they will prioritize their requests to allow seniority prevalence. 
 
 
 
--Normal Block Annual Leave is not subject to the April 1st deadline, 
regardless of when the actual leave occurs.  Normal Block Annual Leave 
requests shall be granted on a “first come, first serve” basis, regardless 
of seniority. 
 
--In the event that more than one employee submits Normal Block Annual 
Leave requests for the same day(s), and these requests are submitted during 
the same eight (8) hour shift, then seniority shall prevail during that 
shift only. 
 
 
 
These situations may occur when an excessive number of employees are 
requesting Normal Block Annual Leave for the same day(s) which would result 
in exceeding the number allowed leave from unit daily personnel assignment 
detail. 
 
 
 
--If an employee commences their block leave then wishes to cancel any 
remaining portion of that leave, AND that block leave cancelled previously 
granted “per diem” leave, the cancellation of the remaining block leave 
must be approved by the Bureau Shift Commander. 
 
 
 
--In the event that any portion of an employee’s block leave is withdrawn, 
the employee whose “per diem” leave was previously canceled as a direct 
result of granted block leave, shall be allowed to resubmit their leave 
request. 

 
 
 
3.                  “Per Diem” annual leave is annual and/or holiday leave 
in which the employee will be absent from duty less than six (6) 
consecutive calendar days.  Whenever possible, requests for “per diem” 
annual leave shall be made at least six (6) days prior to the requested 
day(s) off.  If the request is made six (6) days or less than six (6) days 
prior to the requested day(s) off, the Bureau Shift Commander shall 
authorize “per diem” leave according to the following conditions. 
 
 
 
The following provisions shall apply to all three of the above paragraphs: 
 
 
 
On any given day, a minimum of ten (10%) percent of officers assigned to a 
unit daily personnel assignment detail shall be granted annual leave.  In 
calculating this number, Funeral Leave, Military Leave and Special Duty 
shall not apply.  All other leave shall apply in the calculations. 
 
 
 
“Special Unit Details” within the CIB, UPB, and all other Bureaus shall 
follow the ten (10%) percent rule. Officers assigned to the “PR” shift 
shall be added to the “C” Shift for calculations of leave time. 
 
 
 
4.                  Annual leave shall not accrue during a leave of absence 
without pay in excess of five (5) working days per payroll period.  Annual 
leave shall be granted in minimum increments of one (1) hour. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    SICK LEAVE WITHOUT PAY:  Upon application of an employee, the 
Police Chief may grant sick leave without pay for an entire period under 
those conditions set forth in Section 1 hereof.   When such unpaid sick 
leave exceeds one (1) year, it may be renewed by the Police Chief or the 
Personnel Director or his designated representative.  From time to time the 
Police Chief shall require that the employee submit a certificate from the 
attending physician or practitioner, or submit to a medical examination. 
In the event of a failure or refusal to supply such certificate or if the 
certificate does not clearly show sufficient disability to preclude the 
employee from the performance of his duties, such sick leave shall be 
cancelled and the employee's service terminated.  Employees may be entitled 
to unpaid leave in accordance with the Family Medical Leave Act. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    FUNERAL LEAVE:  In the event of the death of an employee's 
father, mother, step-parent, sister, brother, grandfather, grandmother, 
grandchild, spouse, or child related by blood, marriage, or adoption, the 
employee may, with the approval of the Police Chief or designated 
representative, be permitted to take funeral leave, with pay not to exceed 
five (5) consecutive calendar days including the day of the funeral. 

 
 
 
In the event of the death of an employee's father-in-law, mother-in-law, 
sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandmother-in-law or grandfather-in-law, 
the employee may, with the approval of the Police Chief or his designated 
representative, be permitted to take funeral leave, with pay, not to exceed 
three (3) consecutive calendar days including the day of the funeral. 
 
 
 
Funeral leave may be granted in such other instances as are justified by 
the relationship between the deceased and the employee.  The Police Chief 
or his designee may, in his exercise of discretion, grant funeral leave in 
addition to that provided above. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    MILITARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITH PAY:  An employee who is a 
member of the National Guard, the United States Army Reserve, the United 
States Air Force Reserve, the United States Naval Reserve, the United 
States Marine Corps Reserve, or the United States Coast Guard Reserve, 
shall be entitled to leave of absence from their respective duties, without 
loss of pay, on all days during which they are employed with or without pay 
under the orders or authorization of competent authority on active training 
duty or duty with troops or at field exercise or for instruction, for not 
to exceed fifteen (15) workdays in any one (1) payroll year.  Such leave of 
absence shall be in addition to the regular vacation leave of such 
employees.  Any employee on military leave shall not be counted as being on 
leave for the purposes of determining the maximum number of employees who 
are on annual leave. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6    MILITARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY:  All employees who 
leave a position for the purpose of being inducted into, enlisting in, 
determining his physical fitness to enter, or performing training duty in 
the armed forces of the United States or the National Guard, shall when 
ordered by proper authority to active service, be entitled to a leave of 
absence from such civil employment for the period of such service, plus 
ninety (90) days, without loss of pay during the first fifteen (15) days of 
such leave of absence; provided, such pay for the first fifteen (15) days 
shall not be construed as being in addition to the pay provided for in 
Section 6 hereof.  The proper authority may make a provisional appointment 
to fill any vacancy created by such leave of absence.  When such person is 
separated from active duty under conditions other than dishonorable, he 
shall be entitled to return to his former position or a position of like 
seniority, status, and the then prevailing pay.  If he is not qualified to 
perform the duties of such position upon his return by reason of disability 
sustained during the service but is qualified to perform the duties of any 
other position in the CITY service, he shall be restored to such other 
position, the duties of which he is qualified to perform, as will provide 
him with the same seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest proximation 
thereof consistent with the circumstances in his case.  Application for 
re-employment shall be made within ninety (90) days after he is discharged 
from active duty.  Such person shall not be discharged from his former or 
new position without justifiable cause within one (1) year after 

reinstatement. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7    OTHER LEAVES OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY:  In addition to paid 
leave, employees, including probationary employees, may be allowed to be 
absent from duty without pay for a period not to exceed three (3) months on 
the basis of applications for leave without pay approved by the Police 
Chief and the Personnel Director or his designated representative.  Leave 
may be extended beyond three (3) months only with the approval of the 
Personnel Board.  Such leave shall be granted only when it will not 
adversely affect the interests of the CITY.  An application for leave of 
absence for travel, study, or other educational purposes which will equip 
the employee to render more effective service to the CITY normally shall be 
deemed as not to adversely affect the interests of the CITY. 
 
 
 
SECTION 8    CANCELLATION OF LEAVES OF ABSENCE:  All leaves of absence 
shall be subject to the condition that the Police Chief may cancel the 
leave at any time upon prior written notice to the employee and the 
Personnel Director specifying a reasonable date for termination of the 
leave.  The Personnel Director, or his designated representative, upon 
prior notice to the employee and the Police Chief, may cancel an approved 
leave of absence at any time he finds that the employee is using the leave 
for purposes other than those specified at the time of approval.  In case 
of emergency, the Police Chief may cancel all leaves by verbal or written 
communication. 
 
 
 
SECTION 9    LEAVES OF ABSENCE ? LENGTH OF SERVICE:  As used in this 
Article continuous service or employment means employment with the CITY 
without a break or interruption; provided that any suspension for 
disciplinary reasons as provided in Section 3 of Article 6, any absence on 
authorized leave with pay, authorized absence on leave without pay; or 
lay?off for thirty (30) calendar days or less shall not constitute a break 
or interruption of service or employment within the meaning of this 
Section.  The provisions of this Section shall not apply to military leaves 
as provided in Section 6 hereof, nor to maternity leave, nor UNION leave. 
 
 
 
SECTION 10 AUTHORIZATION FOR LEAVE:  No leave of absence shall be granted 
until leave has been properly approved.  Notification of any leave of 
absence without pay shall be submitted to the Personnel Director prior to 
the taking of leave. 
 
 
 
SECTION 11 LEAVE COMPUTATIONS:  For the purpose of calculations, leave of 
absence shall be computed to the nearest one?half (1/2) hour, and leave 
accruals shall be credited on the same basis.  Employees shall not have 
deductions made from leave accumulations for holidays which occur at the 
beginning, during, or at the end of a period of leave with pay. 
 
 

 
SECTION 12 ABSENCE WITHOUT LEAVE:  Any unauthorized absence of an employee 
from duty shall be deemed to be an absence without pay and may be grounds 
for disciplinary action by the Police Chief.  In the absence of such 
disciplinary action any employee who absents himself for three (3) days or 
more without authorized leave shall be deemed to have resigned. Such 
absence may be covered, however, by the Police Chief by a subsequent grant 
of leave with or without pay where extenuating circumstances are found to 
have existed. 
 
 
 
SECTION 13 JURY DUTY:  When an employee is summoned for jury duty by a 
court of competent jurisdiction and his attendance in court is required 
during his regularly scheduled duty shift with the CITY, he shall receive 
his base pay from the CITY during such service provided he turns his jury 
pay over to the CITY Finance officer for those days he is normally 
scheduled to work and for which remuneration is claimed.  The employee who 
is summoned for jury duty, and whose regular duty shift falls on the same 
day but not on the "B" shift, shall receive his base pay from the CITY 
provided that he turns over the jury  pay to the CITY Finance officer for 
those days he is normally scheduled to work and for which remuneration is 
claimed.  This employee shall be assigned to special duty "B" shift for 
each day he serves on the jury duty during his regular working days. 
 
 
 
SECTION 14 LEAVE - UNION REPRESENTATIVE:  One UNION representative or the 
UNION president shall be entitled to a leave of absence with pay 
unrestricted as to time while he is engaged in UNION activities.  However,

SECTION 2    The parties hereby agree that no officers, agents, 
representatives, members or anyone connected with either party shall in any

SECTION 1    Eight (8) hours shall normally constitute a day's work, except 
for employees working approved 10 or 12 hour days or on the card system, in 
which case a work day shall be 10, 12 or 8 ½ hours respectively.  Forty 
(40) hours per week or the schedule set forth in Article 15, Section 10 
reflecting the card system currently in effect which is not modified by 
this Agreement shall constitute a week's work. The CITY and the UNION may 
mutually agree to establish a ten (10) hour, four (4) day work week for 
designated positions on a trial basis. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    Attendance at Police School, Police Training courses, or 
refresher courses held immediately before or following the tour of active 
duty not in excess of two (2) hours  in any month shall not be considered 
as hours worked under this Agreement. 
 
 
 
                        While the initially hired employees for the 
position of Police Officer are in the Academy phase (not FTO) of training, 
the workday requirements are at the discretion of the training staff, based 
on the need for instruction.  The recruit status employee may be required 
to work up to 9 hours per day providing they not be worked more than 42 
hours per week.  Any time requirement exceeding the 9 hour workday or 42 
hour workweek, would result in compensation at the rate of one and one-half 
the number of hours worked in excess of these work hours.  In addition, 
during one week of the Academy phase, selected wholly at the discretion of 
the training staff regarding date and location, the following applies: 
recruit status employees will be required to work up to 10 hours per day; 
this total time per days is regardless of continuous or continual time 
worked; during this designated week, recruit status employees will be 
required to work up to 47 hours prior to overtime, or time and one-half 
compensation, beyond that threshold. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    An employee shall be allowed a thirty (30) minute lunch period 
with pay, which period shall be considered as time worked under this 
Agreement. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    A calendar day shall be divided into four (4) shifts 
designated as follows:  “A” Shift (2400-0800 hrs.); “B” Shift (0800-1600 
hrs.); “C” Shift (1600-2400 hrs.), and  Priority Response (PR) Shift   The 
“A,” “B,” and “C” shifts may be varied not to exceed two (2) hours, except 
the  “PR” Shift at the sole discretion of the Police Chief or his 

designated representative, provided the employees affected are provided a 
minimum of sixteen (16) hours as to the change of hours for the shift 
 
 
 
The PR Shift shall consist of 4 consecutive 10-hour days (Wed through Sat) 
with 3 days off.  PR Shift workdays may be changed by mutual agreement 
between the CITY and the UNION.  In advance of the UPB bidding process 
employee management shall announce the number of 10-hour shift positions 
for each precinct.  The exact hours of the PR Shift shall be set by 
management in hours ranging between 1600-0400 hours.  Affected employees 
shall be provided a minimum of sixteen (16) hours as to the change of hours 
for their shift.  The City may or may not at its management discretion, 
institute the above PR shift. 
 
 
 
PR Shift employees shall be assigned to Uniform Patrol on an equitable 
basis, based on call load, to cruiser districts. These employees shall 
primarily respond to calls for services with the exception of short-term 
assignments necessitated by public safety priorities.  Uniform Patrol 
Bureau employees assigned to PR Shift shall not exceed thirty-two (32) 
employees or fourteen percent (14%) (whichever is less) of the employees 
assigned to a uniform patrol bureau personnel assignment detail on “A” and 
“C” Shifts at semi-annual shift change and shall not exceed four (4) 
uniform patrol bureau sergeants.  Assignment of employees to PR Shift will 
be implemented at the September 2001 detail change and will be done in 
accordance with Article 10 and Article 15. 
 
 
 
Employees who fill 10-hour day positions (PR Shift) and have at least 4 
years of service with the Omaha Police Department shall reduce the number 
of 4 year employees required to be assigned to “A” and “C” shift crew by 
precinct, according to the following: 
 
 
 
One third of the 10-hour PR Shift 4 year positions assigned to a precinct 
will be credited to “A” shift crews with that precinct and two-thirds will 
be credited to “C” shift crews within that precinct (all fractions shall be 
rounded to the nearest whole).  Positions credited will be distributed as 
evenly as possible among the affected crews in an effort to balance the 
number of 4-year employees actually assigned to crews. 
 
 
 
At the start of each semi-annual detail change, UPB employees assigned to 
10-hour PR shift shall have twenty (20) hours of annual leave credited to 
their payroll annual leave account.  The annual leave guidelines in effect 
in Article 13, Section 16, for the purposes of determining the number of 
employees off on leave shall apply. 
 
 
 
Those assigned to the PR shift shall be recognized as being on the card 
system and therefore entitled to receive card pay. 

 
 
 
 
 
                        AIR SUPPORT UNIT (AIR WING) 
 
 
 
All pilots and observers will be assigned to a 12-hour shift based upon a 
special card system.  This is for the Air Support Unit only. 
 
 
 
It is the intent of this shift in hours to be a one-year trial period. 
This trial period will not exceed the duration of the current Labor 
Agreement.  However, Police Management may cancel the 12 hours at any time 
upon giving two weeks notice to the affected employees in the Air Support 
Unit. Additionally, at the end of the trial period, or before, the parties 
may mutually agree to extend the Air Support Unit to 12 hour shifts for a 
longer period of time. 
 
 
 
Any time an employee on such 12-hour shift takes annual, sick, or any other 
type of leave for his/her entire shift, such employee shall be debited 12 
hours.  (The exception being Sundays, when an 8 hours shift is worked in 
order to comply with FLSA guidelines regarding maximum hours worked.  If 
such employee’s ordinary day off falls on a holiday, he/she shall be paid 
according to the Union Contract - 8 hours of pay. 
 
 
 
Employees in the Air Support Unit working 12 hour shifts will not be 
required to work any supplemental hours contained in the Labor Agreement. 
 
 
 
The exact hours of the shift may be varied from time to time and shall be 
in the sole discretion of employment.  Shift hours will not be changed 
unless such employees are given reasonable notice. 
 
 
 
Because of the card systems for the 12-hour shift, there will be times when 
employees on two different cards will actually work within the actual 24 
hours of the holiday.  When this occurs, any employee whose shift actually 
begins on the holiday or birthday will receive holiday or birthday pay for 
all hours worked that shift.  Employees who work a shift that does not 
begin on the holiday or birthday will not receive holiday pay. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    The shifts designated in Section 4 shall be staffed by Police 
Officers, Sergeants, Lieutenants, and Captains on the basis of bids 
submitted by such employees to be effective on the first Sunday in March, 
and the first Sunday in September of each year on the basis of their 

seniority as defined in Article 10. The CITY shall establish the time 
periods and manner of bidding.  Prior to staffing the shifts, the Police 
Chief shall have the exclusive right of assignment (irrespective of the 
shift bidding process) of personnel and establishment of hours for the 
positions of  Lieutenant of Narcotic Unit; Lieutenant of Internal Affairs; 
Lieutenant of Crime Analysis; Lieutenant of Training; Lieutenant of 
Inspections; Lieutenant of Domestic Services Unit; Lieutenant of Management 
of Called for Services.    After the above positions have been staffed, the 
Chief of Police shall determine personnel assignments.  The following 
exceptions apply: 
 
 
 
Sergeants assigned to UPB patrol area positions and UPB Administrative 
Sergeant positions shall bid for their positions based on their seniority 
within the group of sergeants assigned to these positions.  Employees 
assigned to UPB sergeant’s area positions shall bid for their work shifts 
as well as their positions based on their seniority within the group of 
officers assigned to these positions.  During this process, Police Officers 
(no other ranks) have the opportunity to rebid their shift and bid their 
UPB sergeants areas simultaneously.  The CITY shall establish the time 
periods and manner of bidding. 
 
 
 
On A and C shifts, a minimum of three (3) slots or 33%, whichever is less 
per Sergeant’s areas may be filled by the CITY by assigning by seniority 
those employees who have completed four (4) years of continuous service or 
more. 
 
 
 
The Police Chief may under special circumstances vary the seniority bidding 
system on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 
 
The hours of designated sworn command employees assigned to selected 
positions may be changed upon mutual consent of management and the affected 
sworn command employee based on the needs of that particular position.  The 
change in hours request may be initiated by management or the affected 
sworn command employee.  Any such changes agreed to shall only occur during 
the normal work week (Sunday through Saturday) and shall not carry over 
into another week.  If a dispute arises between the affected sworn command 
employee and management, the dispute will be resolved by the payment of 
overtime to the employee, not to exceed one and one-half times the actual 
hours worked beyond the employee’s regularly scheduled shift.  The use of 
the grievance process will not be used to resolve such disputes. 
 
 
 
Those sworn command employees eligible for consideration for change in 
their ordinary work shift include: 
 
 
 
1.         All existing captains’ positions. 

 
2.         Administrative assistants to the Chief and each Deputy Chief. 
 
3.         Training Commander. 
 
4.         Prevention Programs Commander. 
 
5.         Public Information Office Commander. 
 
6.         Professional Standards (Lieutenant). 
 
7.         Inspections Commander (Lieutenant). 
 
8.         Narcotics/Intelligence (Lieutenant). 
 
9.         Traffic Section (Lieutenant). 
 
 
 
The CITY shall provide a live forum at which employees at the rank of 
Police Officer may present their bids.  Such live forum, as established by 
the CITY, shall be considered optional, and will not be considered hours 
worked unless an officer is scheduled during their normal duty shift. 
 
 
 
When employees are provided this opportunity during their first shift, 
their supervisor should allow them to attend on-duty, if possible. 
However, if the Police Officer is unavailable, his bid sheet form or 
notarized proxy bid will serve as his preference bid for hours and 
sergeant’s area. 
 
 
 
Police Officers with at least four years of continuous service, assigned to 
A or C shift in the initial bid for hours, and subsequently assigned to UPB 
patrol area positions may be restricted to A or C Shift within the group of 
Police Officers assigned to UPB patrol area positions, in order to comply 
with the “four-year rule” described in Section 5 of the current collective 
bargaining agreement. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6    Any vacancy (occurring because of retirement, death, 
promotion, voluntary or involuntary termination, or for any other reason) 
occurring in a shift between bidding dates shall be filled without the 
necessity of rebidding the shift affected.  Such shift vacancy shall be 
filled by that employee who, at the last bidding date, was next in 
seniority to go to that now open shift position, and had bid that shift. 
That employee may decline the shift change and, in that event, the vacancy 
shall be filled by the next senior employee to have bid that shift at the 
last bidding date.  The CITY shall have the exclusive right to assign 
within the shift any employee who changes positions, pursuant to the above, 
between bid dates.  Probationary employees are exempt from Sections 5 and 6 
for the first  eighteen (18) months of employment. 
 
 

 
SECTION 7    During an emergency as declared by the Police Chief, 
employee's shifts, hours, and duties may be established at the discretion 
of the Police Chief. 
 
 
 
SECTION 8    Any change in the work schedule that results in splitting days 
off shall be by mutual agreement of the CITY and the employee, unless said 
split days off apply to forty (40) hour department wide training and unless 
the provisions of Article 15, Section 7, are invoked. 
 
 
 
SECTION 9    Employees who are going to be transferred from non-uniform job 
assignment to a uniform job assignment shall be given a minimum of five (5) 
working days notice. 
 
 
 
SECTION 10  1.  Employees under the card system shall continue to work a 
4-2 scheduling procedure and shall work a shift that is 8 hours 30 
minutes.  The additional thirty (30) minutes shall normally be worked by 
working fifteen (15) minutes prior to the eight (8) hour shift and fifteen 
(15) minutes at the end of the eight (8) hour shift.  It is understood and 
agreed that the current fifteen (15) minute report in time is included 
within and not in addition to the fifteen (15) minute time added to the 
front end of a sworn employee's duty shift. 
 
 
 
It is understood that the thirty (30) minutes provided for herein is 
compensated by the base pay schedule, and no additional compensation 
(either straight time or overtime) shall be paid for these thirty (30) 
minutes.  Further, it is understood that the above division of such thirty 
(30) minute period between the beginning or end of a shift may be changed 
on a case by case basis because of special circumstances (training, special 
events, lead officer, etc.). 
 
 
 
Lead officers will still be required to report early within the adjusted 
provisions of this paragraph, however, the compensation for such time is 
included in the employee’s base pay. 
 
 
 
2.  In addition to the work schedule described in paragraph 1, each sworn 
employee working a 4-2 schedule shall work an additional twelve (12) hours 
per payroll year, referred to as “supplemental hours.” 
 
 
 
3.  The manner and method for working the twelve (12) supplemental hours 
per payroll year provided for in the above paragraph 2 shall be determined 
by the management of the Omaha Police Department subject to the following 
conditions: 

 
 
 
A.  If such assignment does not merge with the employee’s regularly 
scheduled shift, the supplemental hours must be in increments of four (4) 
or more hours, and the employee shall be given a minimum of fourteen (14) 
days notice unless said notice is personally waived by the employee. 
 
 
 
B.  If such supplemental hours merge with the employee's regularly 
scheduled shift, they will be assigned in one (1) hour increments, if 
possible, but in no event shall they be scheduled in increments of less 
than thirty (30) minutes.  An employee shall be given a minimum of sixteen 
(16) hours notice (from the time such supplemental hours are to begin) of 
any supplemental hours unless this notice is personally waived by the 
employees. 
 
 
 
C.  The CITY shall avoid scheduling supplemental hours of work on days off 
adjacent to or during pre-approved block leave and will make a reasonable 
effort to avoid scheduling supplemental hours of work on days off adjacent 
to any pre-approved leave days. The CITY shall also make a reasonable 
effort to schedule supplemental work hours during employee's regularly 
assigned shift hours.  If an employee is assigned to work a specific number 
of supplemental hours and the nature of the work requires that those hours 
be extended, such additional extended supplemental hours shall not be 
compensated as overtime, but shall be credited to the employee’s 
supplemental hours requirement.  If the total hours worked exceeds the 
employee’s supplement requirement for the year, such extension shall be 
considered overtime and paid as such. 
 
 
 
4.  Employees entering the 4-2 plus day off schedule system on and after 
January 1, 1997, shall begin with a balance of extra hours of work due 
equal to one hour per month left in the year for any month where at least 
sixteen (16) calendar days remain.  Employees leaving the 4-2 plus day off 
schedule system at any time during the year shall have their balance of 
supplemental hours of work due canceled. 
 
 
 
If any employee leaves the 4-2 plus schedule and has worked more 
supplemental hours than the number of months the employee was assigned to 
the 4-2 plus schedule, that employee shall be compensated for the 
supplemental hours worked in excess of the amount due.  Payment shall be 
made at the rate of 1½ times that employee’s rate of pay as listed on the 
pay plan for the number of hours worked; however, if overtime hours were 
traded for supplemental hours, the pay back shall be at straight pay at 
that employee’s rate as listed on the pay plan. 
 
 
 
5.  The twelve (12) supplemental hours provided herein in no way affect the 
number of hours an employee earns or uses for any leave, compensated or 

uncompensated.  Employees shall not be allowed annual leave during work 
hours assigned pursuant to this Section. 
 
 
 
6.  It is the understanding and intent of the parties that working 
supplemental time as provided for in this Section shall in no way affect 
the employee's compensation.  If an employee is called in to work 
supplemental hours in an increment of one duty shift (eight hours) the 
employee shall work a shift which includes the thirty (30) minute 
supplemental time. 
 
 
 
Specifically, an employee shall have eight (8) hours deducted from his 
supplemental time obligation for working a shift which is eight (8) hours 
and thirty (30) minutes in length. 
 
 
 
It is the understanding and intent that supplemental time worked on a 
holiday or other supplemental times worked which otherwise might result in 
additional compensation beyond eight (8) hours of base pay shall by virtue 
of this Section result in compensation for eight (8) hours.  In those 
instances where supplemental hours are worked during a designated holiday, 
the employee's assigned compensation shall be increased only by an 
additional factor of 1½ times his base pay.  Specifically, when an employee 
works a full supplemental duty shift (8 hours and 30 minutes) on a 
designated holiday such employee's total compensation for those hours 
worked shall be twelve (12) hours base pay. 
 
 
 
7.  The parties understand and agree that in the event an employee working 
a 4-2 schedule takes paid annual leave or sick leave or any other 
compensated leave for a full duty shift(s) shall be compensated on the 
basis of eight hours irrespective of whether the employee worked more than 
eight (8) hour duty shifts as a consequence of the implementation of this 
Section. 
 
 
 
8.  If an employee utilizes paid sick, annual leave or other paid leave for 
a full duty shift, that employee shall have deducted eight (8) hours from 
his accumulated bank of hours. 
 
 
 
9.  Employees have the option of declaring any earned overtime to be used 
toward owed supplemental hours at the rate of one hour of overtime (1½ 
times the number of hours actually worked) for one hour of supplemental 
time.  (For example:  one hour worked as overtime equals 1½ hours of 
straight pay or 1½ of supplemental time, whichever employee chooses.) 
Employees also have the option of declaring earned court time for two (2) 
court appearances per payroll year (Article 19, Section 2) to be used 
toward maximum of eight (8) supplemental hours.  However, the employee must 
declare the overtime/court time referred to above to be used at the time 

the overtime/court time report was made and can only be used toward 
supplemental hours owed during the same payroll year.

SECTION 1    The UNION agrees that it will not at any time solicit 
membership or collect UNION dues, fees, or assessments of any kind, or 
distribute literature or any other type of printed material on CITY time or 
in CITY buildings or on CITY property. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    However, it is agreed that the solicitation of members and 
distribution of UNION literature of a non?controversial nature will be 
allowed during one thirty?minute presentation to be made by UNION 
representative to each new police recruit class. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    The UNION shall have the right to address the employees at 
shift change assemblies within the following limitations: 
 
 
 
                        1.         approval must be granted by the Police 
Chief in advance of the UNION addressing the employees; 2. approval will be 
granted a maximum of once every thirty (30) days; 3. such UNION address 
will be limited to a maximum of five (5) minutes.

                   OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYEE DUTIES 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT UNIFORM:  Employees shall be 
entitled to engage in outside employment, including employment or service 
as an appointed officer for any public body, with full police authority, 
including powers of arrest, which does not require the use of the official 
uniform as defined in the Department's rules and regulations and which is 
not otherwise prohibited by the provisions of this Agreement, provided that 
the duties of the outside employment do not constitute a conflict of 
interest nor conflict with an employee's performance of his duties with the 
CITY.  The provisions of this Section shall be enforced by the Police Chief 
or his designated representative whose decision shall be final and binding 

and not subject to appeal or review by an arbitrator or Personnel Board. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT WITH UNIFORM:  Employees may be allowed to 
engage in outside employment, with full police authority, including powers 
of arrest, which does require the use of the official uniform as defined in 
the Department's rules and regulations and which is not otherwise 
prohibited by the provisions of this Agreement, provided that prior 
approval is obtained by the employee from the Police Chief. 
 
 
 
In the event an employment opportunity arises at such a time when it is 
impossible to obtain the prior approval required above and an employee 
desires to engage in outside employment, then, and only then, a lieutenant 
or the person assigned in his stead may approve such employment.  Such 
approval shall not be granted unless there remains less than seventy?two 
(72) hours prior to the commencement of such employment, detailing the 
place of employment, duration of employment and type of employment; 
provided, that no approval shall be granted unless the employment shall 
conclude within forty?eight (48) hours after the employment is to commence. 
 
 
 
Provided further, that no approval shall be granted by a lieutenant or his 
stead unless:  1) the job the employee desires has been previously approved 
by the Police Chief; or b) the nature or type of employment is that which 
has been previously approved by the Police Chief, which shall be determined 
by existing regulations and procedures; or c) on short term notice, a 
lieutenant may authorize any outside employment not in conflict with the 
CITY. 
 
 
 
The regular procedure for approval must be utilized where the employment is 
continuing after 48 hours from commencement or the employee has more than 
seventy?two (72) hours notice.  The provisions of this Section shall be 
enforced by the Police Chief or his designated representative whose 
decision shall be final and binding and not subject to appeal or review by 
an arbitrator or Personnel Board. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    EMPLOYMENT IN TWO OR MORE DEPARTMENTS:  No employee shall be 
employed simultaneously by two (2) or more departments of the CITY when the 
total number of hours worked exceeds the normal work week in either 
department.

SECTION 1    For the purpose of this Article only "private citizen" is 
defined as an individual not in the employ of the Omaha Police Department 
and "formal complaint" is defined as a report by a private citizen alleging 
misconduct by an employee against that citizen while the employee is 
engaged in his official police duties. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    A private citizen who desires to file a formal complaint 
against an employee shall be required to sign and attest a formal complaint 
form specifying the misconduct of the employee in the presence of a command 
officer or an Internal Affairs officer of the Omaha Police Department. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    The Police Department will receive, and is not precluded by 
the above from receiving, information or other complaints on an informal 
basis.  Third party complaints will be received as information and 
processed on an individual basis. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    This Article is not subject to review under Article 7, APPEAL 
PROCEDURE. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    Upon assignment of discipline, and prior to appeal of said

documentation used during the investigation. 
 
 
 
 
 
                                ARTICLE 18a 
 
 
 
                       EMPLOYEES’ BILL OF RIGHTS 
 
 
 
All employees within the Bargaining Unit shall be entitled to the 
protection of what shall hereafter be termed as the "Police Officers' Bill 
of Rights" which shall be added to the present Rules and Regulations of the 
Omaha Police Department.  The rights and procedures contained herein shall 
not apply to any criminal investigations. 
 
 
 

                        A.  The Omaha Police Department will not solicit 
any formal citizens' complaints against any employee; solicitation shall 
not be construed to mean any follow?up of a third?party complaint or 
follow?up of first?party complaints. 
 
 
 
                        B.  An employee shall not be subjected to any 
offensive language, nor shall he be threatened with dismissal, transfer or 
other disciplinary punishment as a guise to attempt to obtain his 
resignation, nor shall he be intimidated in any other manner.  No promises 
or rewards shall be made to the employee as an inducement to answer 
questions. 
 
 
 
C.  An accused employee shall be informed of the nature of the 
investigation and shall receive a copy of the written formal citizens' 
complaints against him at least twenty?four (24) hours prior to his formal 
interrogation by the Police Department.  This twenty?four (24) hour period 
may be waived if the complaint alleges intoxication or drug incapacitation 
during on duty status.  The accused employee shall be permitted to have 
either his choice of an attorney or UNION Official or both present during 
the interrogation.  Should the employee not be able to obtain and consult 
with a UNION representative, the employee may be granted an additional 24 
hours, or less, by the Internal Affairs Lieutenant.  The employee being 
interrogated shall be made aware of the fact that any statement made may be 
used by the Department as part of the investigation.  If the Department 
chooses to tape record any portion of the proceedings, it must record the 
entire proceedings and the employee shall be made aware that a recording is 
being made.  The only tape recording of proceedings allowed shall be by the 
investigating employee.  The only tape recording of the investigative 
interview allowed shall be by the investigating employee.  Should any 
disciplinary action be taken as a result of this investigation, the CITY 
will provide, at the employee’s request, a complete duplicate recording of 
his taped interview and a transcript. 
 
 
 
If, during the course of an interview, a witness employee reasonably 
believes that he may become the target of an investigation which could 
result in disciplinary action, such employee may request UNION 
representation and 24-hour notice as well as other rights afforded under 
Article 18(a).  The Internal Affairs investigator will document the request 
by the witness employee and use his sole discretion whether to complete the 
interview. Prior to being interviewed such witness employee shall be 
advised, in writing, of the above. 
 
 
 
D.  If an employee is being investigated and interviewed by superior 
officers in his section because of an internal infraction, the following 
procedure must be followed. 
 
 
 
If the result of the investigation which shall be completed before the 

termination of the duty day shows that the discipline to be recommended by 
section supervisor(s) will be greater than a written reprimand, the 
continuing investigation shall be performed by the Internal Affairs Unit or 
the Professional Standards Commander. 
 
 
 
When the investigation is being conducted by Professional Standards or the 
Internal Affairs Unit, the employee will be afforded the protections 
outlined in Sub?Section (C) of this Article. 
 
 
 
E.  The interrogation shall be conducted at a reasonable hour, preferably 
at a time when the employee is on duty, or during the normal waking hours 
for the employee.  If such interrogation is conducted during off?duty time, 
the employee shall be compensated in accordance with regular overtime 
procedures. 
 
 
 
                        F.  The employee shall be informed prior to the 
interrogation of the name and rank of the person in charge of the 
interrogation, the interrogating officers, and all other persons to be 
present during the interrogation.  All questions directed to the employee 
under interrogation shall be asked by only one interrogator at one time.

20% of $2,500 post?deductible prescription expenses) in a given calendar 
year, the card will allow the employee to obtain prescriptions at a flat 
rate of $3.00 per prescription. 
 
 
 
6.  It is understood that the employee percentage cost per prescription may 
be higher when prescriptions are purchased outside the City if 
participating pharmacies are available.  Additionally, the employee will be

filing process.

time (in excess of thirty days) may be required to purchase such 
medications from a designated dispensary through the U.S. mail.

Thousand Dollars ($40,000) per employee. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    An employee may decline to pay such premium and thereby 
decline CITY coverage only if he/she has in full force and effect 
equivalent health insurance coverage from another source.  The CITY shall 
be the sole judge in determining equivalency and such decision shall not be 
appealable by grievance or any other legal action. 
 
 
 
If an employee covered by this Agreement is married to another employee 
covered by this Agreement or another CITY employee, such covered employee 
may decline to pay such premium and rely on spouse's policy for family 
coverage.  However, it is understood that in such a situation benefits 
would only be paid up to the limits of that one policy. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    The CITY shall not be responsible for providing any life, 
health or dental coverage referred to in this Article for any employee who 
within any calendar month has not received any compensation from the CITY

Article 13, Section 15), except as provided under the Family Medical Leave 
Act or COBRA.  Payments made pursuant to the provisions of the Nebraska 
Workmen's Compensation Act, payment at termination of accrued vacation 
leave, and payment at termination of earned compensatory time shall not be 
considered compensation for work performed or utilization of paid leave 

within the meaning of this Section.  IOD payments shall be considered 
compensation within the meaning of this Section. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6    If an employee for whom the CITY is not providing life, health 
or dental coverage by virtue of the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 desires 
to continue such coverage, if available, it shall be the responsibility of 
the employee to make the necessary arrangements for coverage in accordance 
with the terms and conditions prescribed by the carrier, or CITY, at the 
employee's cost. 
 
 
 
SECTION 7    If an employee for whom the CITY is not providing life, health 
or dental coverage by virtue of the provisions of Sections 4 and 5, becomes 
re?eligible for coverage with the CITY such coverage shall commence at such 
time as coverage is provided in accordance with the prescribed terms and 
conditions of the group policy, or if the employee has maintained such 
coverage at his own cost at such time as the employee becomes re?eligible 
for such coverage. 
 
 
 
SECTION 8    The CITY and UNION shall study and make recommendations on 
reducing the CITY’S cost of health coverage.  The committee will review the 
present hospital and medical insurance program and determine modifications 
needed to reduce the cost of health care to the CITY. 
 
 
 
The joint committee shall be made up of six (6) members: the Chief 
Negotiator for the UNION, the Labor Relations Director, two members from 
the UNION negotiation team and two from the CITY negotiation team.

June 1, 2001, all fertility procedures and fertility drug coverage is 
eliminated as a covered benefit for the subscribers and their dependents. 
 
 
 
SECTION 12 The family of any sworn employee who dies while on duty during 
the performance of his official police duties shall be provided health care 
and dental coverage by the CITY consistent with those benefits provided by 
this Article.  Said health insurance benefits are hereby provided to the 
surviving spouse and dependent children of any sworn employee qualifying 
under this Section by virtue of a work related death, as described 
hereinabove, occurring on or after the effective date of this Agreement. 
Provided, that said health benefits (1) for any surviving spouse qualifying 
under this Section shall cease upon his/her remarriage or the attainment of 
age sixty-five (65) or whatever age of entitlement to Medicare as set by 
Federal Law, whichever event comes later.  In the event the spouse of the 
decedent does not qualify for Medicare, the health insurance coverage 
provided herein shall cease upon the surviving spouse’s 65th birthday; and 
(2) for any dependent children shall extend through age nineteen (19) or 
through age twenty-three (23) so long as such children are full time 
students. 
 
 
 
SECTION 13 Effective June 1, 2001, the current coverage will be changed to 
a Base/Major Medical Plan with a Preferred Provider (PPO) network 
component. 
 
 
 
                        For Base Services (inpatient care, and inpatient or 
outpatient surgeries), when services are received by a BluePreferred 
provider, there will be no deductible or coinsurance required from the 
covered person.  For Major Medical services, there will be a $100 
Deductible and 20% Coinsurance requirement, up to a Deductible and 
Coinsurance Limit of $500 per person--per calendar year. 
 
 
 
                        When services are received by an out-of-network 
(non-Preferred) provider, a $300 deductible and 20% coinsurance will be 
applicable to all services.  The Deductible and Coinsurance Limit for the 
non-PPO services will be $1,000 for an individual and/or $2,000 aggregate 
per family per calendar year. 
 
 
 
                        Effective December 23, 2001, the major medical 
coinsurance limit shall be $500 per person, per calendar year with family 
aggregate of twice the individual amount.

                          HEALTH CARE FOR RETIREES 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    CITY agrees to provide, at the CITY’S cost, health care 

coverage for those employees and their dependents who retire on or after 
January 1, 1979.  Said health insurance coverage is to be substantially the 
same as that currently provided for employees and their dependents, as more 
specifically provided for in Appendix "C" hereof. 
 
 
 
It is expressly understood and agreed to by the parties that the health 
care benefit provided herein is to be an obligation of the CITY only with 
respect to those employees who obtain a normal service retirement and their 
dependents.  Additionally, the benefit provided herein is confined to those 
employees who have reached minimum retirement age and no greater than 65 
years of age.  Said health care benefit shall be applicable only as long as 
the retired employee shall survive, and in no event shall the CITY be 
obligated to continue premium payments after the death of the employee for 
the benefit of surviving spouse or children. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    Any employee who retires on a service connected disability 
pension shall be eligible for health care coverage substantially the same 
as provided to the employee and dependent coverage as in Appendix "C" 
hereof.  This coverage shall cease upon the retiree's 65th birthday, or 
whatever age of entitlement to Medicare as set by Federal Law, whichever 
event comes later.  In the event the retired employee does not qualify for 
Medicare, the health insurance coverage provided herein shall cease upon 
the employee's 65th birthday. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    Any employee who retires on a non?service connected disability 
pension who has reached the minimum retirement age and twenty-five (25) 
years of service shall be eligible for health care coverage substantially 
the same as provided to the employee and dependent coverage as in Appendix 
"C" hereof. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4    It is further understood by and between the parties that the 
above referenced health care coverage shall cease on the first day of the 
month in which the employee turns 65 years of age or dies, whichever is 
earlier. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5    For those employees who have not reached 50 years of age but 
have reached 47 years of age and have 20 years of service credit or more, 
the following bridge/gap insurance option is allowed if the employee leaves 
employment and defers his retirement: 
 
                        The employee may elect to continue his health care 
coverage in effect at the time he leaves CITY employment.  In order to do 
so he must pay to the CITY, on a monthly basis, the COBRA premium.  This 
payment will be made by automatic deposit to the city with the proper 
account set up as soon as practically possible following the date the 
employee leaves CITY service.  When the former employee reaches age 50 and 
is granted a deferred service retirement he shall receive health care 

coverage pursuant to Section 1, above (Employee no longer is required to 
pay premium).  Any failure to pay the COBRA premium will result in 
permanent cancellation of health care benefits, including the right to 
Section 1 coverage (no premium) after the employee receives a deferred 
retirement. 
 
 
 
                        An employee who leaves CITY employment and pays the 
“gap” health care premium pursuant to the above shall receive the same 
health care coverage during the “gap” period as do sworn employees.  When 
such coverage is converted to Section 1 and Section 4 retiree coverage, all 
other provisions of that Section shall apply.

year.

                    EXAMINATIONS AND PROMOTION PROCEDURE 
 
 
 
SECTION 1        Notice of promotional examination shall be given ninety 

(90) days prior to the administration of the initial phase of the 
examination process, which examination shall take place ninety (90) days 
prior to termination of the current eligibility list.  At the time of 
posting, such notice shall contain the date of the written exam as well as 
the date(s) of the subsequent steps in the selection process. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2        The certified promotional eligibility list shall continue 
in force two (2) years, unless prior to this time all names on the 
certified promotional eligibility list have been exhausted.  If no names 
remain on the certified promotional eligibility list, then that list shall 
be considered as terminated and, within thirty (30) days, a posting of a 
promotional examination shall be made in accordance with Section 1. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3        Eligibility requirements, including school points and 
seniority city service points shall be met prior to the first day of the 
month in which the first examination phase is given. 
 
 
 
School and city service points must be earned prior to the first day of the 
month in which the first examination phase is given. 
 
 
 
SECTION 4        It is understood and agreed that the CITY has the absolute 
right to establish minimum qualifying standards for any Bargaining Unit 
classification within the Omaha Police Department.  Qualifying standards 
shall include but are not limited to, educational, medical, physical, 
testing procedures and years of experience requirements. 
 
 
 
To be eligible for a promotional examination for a bargaining unit 
classification rank within the Omaha Police Department, the candidate must 
establish the minimum years of qualifying experience as a sworn employee 
with the CITY Police Department, without any breaks or interruption in 
service from either the date of employment or re?employment of the employee 
provided that lay?off of one year or less, any suspensions for disciplinary 
purposes, absence on authorized leave with or without pay, absence while 
receiving temporary total disability benefits under the Nebraska Workmen's 
Compensation Act, shall not constitute a break or interruption in service 
within the meaning of this Article. 
 
 
 
SECTION 5        Any promotional vacancy existing shall be filled within 
thirty (30) days of the vacancy if a certified promotional list is in 
existence. 
 
SECTION 6        College and city service points shall be included for 
sworn Police Department promotional examinations as follows: 
 
 

 
A.    Such points shall be computed by the Personnel Department using 
criteria identified in the posting; 
 
 
 
B.    Such points shall not be added unless a candidate has first met the 
pre-established pass/fail score for each part of the examination; 
 
 
 
C.  1.          The score for the initial phase of the examination, which 
is a precondition to continuing in the examination process, shall be 
calculated by adding: 
 
 
 
·        The earned score on the initial phase of the examination, which 
shall have a maximum of 100 points, 
 
·        A maximum of 10 points for city service.  As used hereafter, city 
service points shall mean and be computed as follows: 
 
·        Credit for service with the City will be given on the basis of 
one-twelfth of a point per completed month of service as a sworn member of 
the Police Department, to a maximum of ten points after the service years 
needed to meet the experience requirements, as identified on the posting, 
have been subtracted. 
 
·        A maximum of 10 points for college for Police exams.  As used 
hereafter, college shall mean and be computed as follows: 
 
·        College credits for Police promotional exams will be given on the 
basis of one-twelfth of a point for each credit hour of completed course 
work toward a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice or Law Enforcement, to 
a maximum of ten points.  A candidate who has a post graduate degree, such 
as a Master’s Degree, Ph.D., law degree, will receive 10 points for 
college. 
 
·        Credits will be evaluated on the basis of the course catalog from 
the University of Nebraska at Omaha. 
 
 
 
The final score from which the ranking on the eligibility list is 
determined, shall be computed as follows: 
 
 
 
·        70% of the percentage score (based on a 100% scale) achieved on 
the subsequent phases(s) of the examination process, plus 
 
·        24% of the percentage score (based on a 100% scale) achieved on 
the initial test identified in C(1) above, plus 
 
·        3%  of the city service points identified in C(1) above, (computed 
as a percentage of the total points available) plus 

 
·        3% of the college points identified in C(1) above (computed as a 
percentage of the total points available). 
 
 
 
The following example serves to illustrate how such points are allocated: 
 
 
 
Assume that an applicant for a Police Sergeant promotional exam achieves a 
score of 80% on the initial test, (the multiple-choice exam), out of a 
possible 100%.  Also assume that this applicant has 10 city service points, 
and 5 college points. This candidate’s scores would be combined, for a 
total of 95 points, in order to determine if he/she would be invited to the 
second phase of the testing process, the Assessment Center. 
 
 
 
Assume that this candidate qualified to participate in the Assessment 
Center, and achieved a rating on the Assessment Center of 70%. The 
candidate’s rating of 80 on the multiple choice will receive a weight of 
24%, college and city service will each receive a weight of 3%, 
respectively, and his/her rating of 70% on the Assessment Center will 
receive a weight of 70%.  This combined score will determine the 
candidate’s final ranking on the eligibility list.  In this example, this 
candidate’s final score will be 72.7, which is computed as follows: 
 
 
 
Multiple Choice exam:  (This candidate answered 80% of the questions 
correctly, and therefore achieved 80% of the total possible points on this 
test.) 
 
 
 
80%    X         .24 =               .192 
 
 
 
City Service (10 points out of a possible 10 or 100%): 
 
 
 
100%  X        .03 =               .03 
 
 
 
College (5 points out of a possible 10 points or 50% of the available 
points) 
 
 
 
50%    X         .03 =               .015 
 
 
 

Assessment Center:                         70%    X        .7 =     .49 
 
 
 
Total: 
.727 
 
 
 
Therefore, the candidate in this example received a combined rating of 
.727, which is equal to 72.2% of the available points or total number of 
points possible on all parts of the test combined, based on the following: 
 
 
 
80% of the total possible on the written test (which was weighted 24%) 
 
100% of the total possible number of city service points (weighted 3%) 
 
50% of the total possible number of college points (weighted 3%) 
 
70% of the total possible points from the Assessment Center (weighted 70%). 
 
 
 
Under this contractual provision, college and city service points will be 
considered during the initial phase of the exam process, as well as the 
subsequent phase(s).  However, these points are assigned a lower weight 
when computing the final score than they received at the initial phase.

be payable to a widow or widower of a member, deferred pensioner or retiree 
if the widow/widower was legally married to the member or retiree at least 
one full year prior to the death of the member or retiree.  Benefits will 
continue for the widow or widower until death unless he or she shall 
remarry.  If the widow or widower remarries, all rights to such pension 
shall be terminated forever.  Pension benefits for a widow or widower shall 
be as follows: 
 
 
 
A.  If a member who is not eligible for retirement dies as a result of

member’s total annual compensation from the highest consecutive 26 
bi-weekly payroll periods within the last five (5) years of service. 
 
 
 
i.  If the widow or widower was not legally married to the member for a 
full year; or if the widow or widower remarries after commencing benefits

(B)  If a member who is not eligible for retirement dies from causes not 
connected with service, the widow or widower shall be paid a monthly

consecutive 26 bi-weekly payroll periods within the last five (5) years of 
service shall be divided equally among eligible children.  The pension for 
each child shall be paid monthly to age 18 or death or marriage, whichever 
occurs first.  In the event any child is totally disabled at the time of 
death of a member or retiree and has been so totally disabled or totally 
dependent for support since prior to age 18, whether or not such child was 
under the age of 18 at the time of such death, such monthly pension benefit 
shall be paid until the cessation of total disability or dependency for 
support, whichever occurs first.  Any payment made under the section, 
regardless of whether due or hereinafter to become due, at the option of 
the CITY, may be paid to any parent or guardian of the child or children 
for his/her or their care, either method of payment being in full

(2)               Upon approval by the System’s Board of a former member’s 
application for refund of contributions when the former member had elected

made. 
 
 
 
(3)               Upon the death of an employee or retiree where no widow 
or widower or children are left surviving who are entitled to pension

excess of total pension payments made to the retiree, or $500.00, whichever 
is greater, shall be made to the designated beneficiary or heirs at law. 
 
 
 
(4)               Upon cessation of pension benefits to a widow or widower 
or child(ren), a lump sum payment equal to the balance, if any, of the 
deceased’s accumulated contributions in excess of the total amount of 
pension payments made to the retiree, widow, widower, and child(ren) shall 
be made to the widow or widower or child who is last to cease receiving a 
pension benefit from the System.  Upon the payment of such lump sum amount, 
if any, the widow or widower and children shall have no future rights and 
privileges under the System. 
 
 
 
(5)               Such refund as provided herein shall forever forfeit any 
and all rights to pension benefits from the System. 
 
 
 
SECTION 6:  DEATH BENEFITS 
 
 
 
Within three (3) business days from the date the Personnel Department 
receives appropriate certification of a member’s or retiree’s death, a lump 
sum death benefit shall be paid to the deceased’s designated beneficiary. 
 
 
 
a.   Upon the death of a member where a widow or widower or child(ren) are 
left surviving who are eligible for pension benefits, a lump sum death

plan salary shall be based on the “F” Step pay rate for Police Officer from 
the current pay plan. 
 
 

 
b.   Upon the death of a retiree where a widow or widower or child(ren) are 
left surviving who are eligible for pension benefits, a lump sum death 
benefit of $1,000.00 shall be made.  The lump sum death benefit shall be 
charged against and deducted from the accumulated contributions of the 
deceased retiree. 
 
 
 
c.   Upon the death of a member or retiree where there is no widow or 
widower or child(ren) surviving who are eligible for pension benefits, a 
lump sum equal to the deceased member’s accumulated contributions, if any, 
or $500.00, whichever is greater, shall be made to the designated 
beneficiary. 
 
SECTION 7:  PENSION SUPPLEMENT 
 
 
 
The CITY will provide a pension supplement of three percent (3%) or fifty 
dollars ($50) per month, whichever amount is less, beginning in the 
thirty-seventh (37th) month of retirement.  This supplement shall continue 
on an annual basis with increases effective on the pension anniversary 
date. 
 
 
 
SECTION 8:  “QUALIFIED PLAN” 
 
 
 
The CITY shall take such action as is necessary so that the System will 
continue to be a plan qualified under applicable Internal Revenue Service 
rules, which status will allow the employee to pay his portion of the 
pension contribution before federal income tax is withheld.

                   JOB PERFORMANCE INTERVIEW (COUNSELING) 
 
 
 
SECTION 1    The CITY shall institute formalized employee job performance 
interviews (counseling).  These interviews will be conducted with employees 
on an as needed basis.  The purpose of these interviews is to bring to the 
attention of the affected employee his unacceptable job performance and/or 
failure to follow specific job instructions.  Such interviews shall be 
documented in writing on a form provided by the CITY.  The employee must 
sign such documentation form.  The original of the form shall be maintained 
in the employee's individual personnel file at the Police Department; a 
copy shall be given to the employee.  No other copies of the form shall be 
distributed. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    An employee, on request, may inspect his Departmental 
personnel file, however no material may be removed or mechanically 
reproduced from this file except as herein provided.  Should the employee 
feel that such file contains erroneous information he may request an 
administrative review by the Police Chief.  Any other inspection of an 
employee's Departmental personnel file may be done only with the 
authorization of the Police Chief.  This form must provide a space for the 
employee to explain his actions.  No employee job performance interview 
over one (1) year old will be used as a basis to show any type of 
behavioral or performance pattern. 
 
 
 
SECTION 3    An employee may request that any job performance interview 

that is greater than one (1) year old be removed from his Police file.  The 
employee will be provided with such document.  No copy or notation of such 
document will be maintained in the employee’s Police file; however, such 
job performance interview will be maintained in a generic Police file not 
under any employee’s name.  Such documentation may be used only for 
purposes of litigation not relating to the employee’s discipline; or in 
appeals, arbitration or litigation relating to the employee’s discipline 
only for purposes of impeachment.

Group "B" 
 
                                    any other sworn employees 
 
 
 
Every six months (at duty change) the Police Chief shall provide to the 
Personnel Director of the CITY a list of Group "A" sworn employees.  Such 
list shall be by serial number and the name of each employee shall not be 
noted.  The Personnel Director, at any time, may direct the Police Chief to 
order all members of Group "A" to take a drug test within 48 hours of 
notification.  It is the general intent and desire of the CITY to test 
Group "A" employees approximately twice a year.  However, tests may be 

ordered at any time, and the cumulative effect of such orders may be more 
or less than a twice a year average. 
 
 
 
The Personnel Director may direct the Police Chief to order members of 
Group "B" to take a drug test pursuant to the following: 
 
 
 
1.         Every six (6) months (at duty change) the Police Chief shall 
provide to the Personnel Director of the CITY a list of Group "B" sworn 
employees.  Such list shall be by serial number and the name of each 
employees shall not be noted. 
 
 
 
2.         Twice during any given six (6) month period the Personnel 
Director may provide a list of approximately 1/6 of employees on "B" list 
to the Police Chief.  The Personnel Director may direct the Police Chief to 
order those employees to submit to a drug test within 48 hours of 
notification. 
 
 
 
All drug tests ordered pursuant to the above random testing policy shall be 
performed in accordance with the mandates of the currently existing CITY 
Drug/Alcohol policy.  In selecting Group "B" personnel for testing, the 
Personnel Director shall utilize a probability sampling technique called 
"simple random selection with replacement."  A computer generated file of 
random employees shall be used. 
 
 
 
The purpose is to insure that each member of Group "B" has a similar 
probability of being selected if the drug test is ordered. 
 
 
 
The CITY agrees to strike that language from current CITY Policy on 
Drug/Alcohol which mandates termination of sworn employees for positive 
tests for alcohol. 
 
 
 
Any notification of an employee of the results of any test given pursuant 
to Random Drug Test Policy or the CITY’S for?cause test policy shall be 
either: 1) personally delivered; or 2) delivered by certified mail or 
bonded courier. 
 
 
 
Further, it is understood by and between the parties that St. Joseph's 
Hospital is currently designated by the CITY pursuant to the CITY Policy to 
be the testing facility.  St. Joseph's has, in its agreement with the CITY 
(which agreement the UNION has reviewed and is familiar with), agreed to 
certain minimum standards for privacy and lab integrity.  The CITY agrees 

that those minimum standards shall be at all times maintained. 
 
 
 
Further, it is agreed that should an employee test impaired for alcohol 
pursuant to any CITY policy, that employee need not necessarily be 
terminated, but shall be disciplined pursuant to the provision of the 
CITY’S Policy on Drugs/Alcohol.  This could include termination, but 
termination is not the only option. 
 
 
 
Employees on sick leave or I.O.D. status shall be directed to take the drug 
test if their serial number is selected (as either Group "A" or "B"). 
However, in so doing, the Police Chief shall give special consideration to 
the particular illness/injury of the employee.  Any questions as to whether 
or not the employee is medically able to submit to such testing shall be 
decided by a competent physician.  Verifiable phone communication from such 
physician can be the basis for the CITY declining to order the employee to 
appear. 
 
 
 
Employees on pre?approved annual leave will not be ordered to submit to 
drug testing while on such leave.  When such employee returns from leave, 
he shall be ordered to take the drug test, pursuant to the above policy. 
 
 
 
Whenever possible, random drug testing shall be ordered during an 
employee’s regularly scheduled work hours. 
 
 
 
SECTION 2    In addition to the above random testing, it is further agreed 
that any employee may be required to submit himself to drug testing if: 
1.  that employee has been involved in an on-duty automobile accident; 2. 
that employee has fired his weapon on-duty other than in a training 
situation.  For this accident/occurrence testing, all the same rules and 
safeguards provided above shall apply to the employee.

                         OUT-OF-CLASSIFICATION PAY 
 
 
 
            Employees required to work out-of-classification in a higher 
rank shall be paid such higher rank classification base pay beginning with 
the performance of such work on the sixth (6th) consecutive day.  Such 
employee shall be paid at the lowest base rate of the higher rank. 

 
 
 
            The parties agree that out-of-classification pay shall not 
occur unless the employee is specifically ordered by police management 
(Chief or Deputy Chief) to work the position.  If the employee is directed 
to work out of class by other than police management, he should notify his 
Deputy Chief immediately.  If the affected employee is not notified to the 
contrary by police management, by the 3rd working day, he shall consider 
the assignment approved.  Further, the CITY agrees that upon the 
designation of a particular employee to work out-of-classification, that 
particular employee designation will continue on for the duration of the 
incumbent’s vacancy, except for cause.

                             COMPENSATORY TIME 
 
 
 
            An employee shall have the option of accruing compensatory 
leave time at a rate of one and one-half (1½) times the actual hours worked 
in lieu of the payment of overtime.  Employees may accrue a maximum of two 
hundred eighty (280) hours of compensatory time.  The compensatory time off 
shall be taken at a time mutually agreed upon by the employee and his 
supervisor but must be taken within three months after the end of the 
calendar year in which it is earned.  Any compensatory time remaining at 
the end of this period shall be paid for in cash.  However, the employee 
retains the right to cash out his/her compensatory time at any time. 
 
 
 
            It is understood that the usage of compensatory time is to be 
requested just like annual leave, and may be denied as any other annual 
leave.  Pursuant to Article 13, Section 15, for the purpose of determining 
the number of employees off on leave, comp time shall be considered as 
annual leave. 
 
 
 
            For purposes of this Article, time worked shall include court 
or call-in time. 
 
 
 
            Any overtime, including holiday pay for time actually worked, 
court pay or call-in pay is eligible to be selected by the employee.  Any 
pay earned at straight time shall be placed in the employee's comp time 
bank at straight time; any pay earned at overtime rates shall be placed in 
the employee's comp time bank at time and one-half.

            Those employees working under the card system shall be paid 

“card pay” by the CITY.  Such employees shall receive an additional one and 
one half percent (1.5%) of the top Police Officer’s base pay.  The CITY 
shall pay this employee in equal increments, coinciding with the pay 
periods, as follows: 
 
 
 
 
$27.80 per pay period for 2001 ($722.74)

CONTINUING NEGOTIATIONS 
 
 
 
            Notwithstanding that this Agreement settles all issues of 
wages, hours, and working conditions for the years covered, the parties 
agree to negotiate during the term of this Agreement regarding the 
following issues: 
 
 
 
            1.         a new "performance based" pay system; 
 
 
 
            2.         the utilization of one, or more, H.M.O. options to 
current health insurance coverage; 
 
 
 
            3.         the creation and implementation of a voluntary, 
minimum physical fitness standard which shall be graded according to the 
age of the employee. 
 
 
 
            Furthermore, the parties agree to negotiate all pension 
benefits currently provided should Social Security become mandatory. 
 
 
 

            The CITY and the UNION agree to create procedures to jointly, 
strongly urge employees to give at least one (1) year notice of planned 
retirement.

                                 TRADE TIME 
 
 
 
Subject to prior supervisory approval, and if allowed (without additional 
pay) under the Fair Labor Standards Act, non-probationary employees within 
the same classification and shift, shall be allowed to voluntarily trade 
duty shifts.  Supervisory approval shall not be unreasonably denied.  The 
CITY shall not incur overtime solely as a result of the trade.  Trades 
shall be in minimum increments of full shifts, and shall be on a temporary 
basis.  Designated holidays shall be excluded. 
 
 
 
Written notification signed by both employees involved in the trade must be 
provided on a form supplied by the Omaha Police Department.  All trades 
must be completed within the same calendar year.  Trade time cannot be 
utilized more than four (4) times in a calendar year by any individual 
employee. 
 
 
 
At any time an employee leaves employment with the Police Department and 
becomes entitled to pay off of his accrued sick and/or annual leave, a 
determination shall be made by the CITY of whether that employee owes 
another employee trade time pay back.  Should it be determined that the 
employee owes trade time it is understood that such amounts will be 
withheld and paid to the CITY.  Employees shall, upon application for 
retirement, be required to sign an agreement reflecting the above.

effect from and after December 24, 2000, until December 20, 2003, and

The parties have agreed to certain coverage changes and health care

have discussed changing the benefits schedule to the current Blue

agreement on this issue.  If, at any time in the future, the UNION wishes 
to substitute the current Blue Cross/Blue Shield Master Contract with any 
mutually agreed upon endorsements for the above health insurance benefits 

summary, the CITY would agree to such substitution.
