14 - To the extent allowed by the laws of the State of Michigan, it is agreed that:  

a. Employees covered by this Agreement at the time it becomes effective and 
who are members of the Union at that time shall be required as a condition of 
continued employment to continue membership in the Union for the duration of 
this Agreement.  

b. Employees covered by this Agreement who are not members of the Union at 
the time it becomes effective shall be required as a condition of continued 
employment to become members of the Union for the duration of this Agreement 
on or before the tenth (10th) day after the thirtieth (30th) day following such 
effective date, or pay to the Union a sum equivalent to the initiation fee and 
membership dues as a charge for representation services.  

c. Employees hired, rehired, reinstated or transferred into the bargaining unit 
after the effective date of this Agreement and covered by this Agreement shall 
be required as a condition of continued employment to become members on or 
before the tenth (10th) day after the thirtieth (30th) day following the beginning of 
their employment in the unit or pay to the Union a sum equivalent to the initiation 
fee and membership dues as a charge for representation services.  

d. An employee who shall tender an initiation fee (if not already a member) and 
the periodic dues, or a sum equivalent to the initiation fee and periodic dues, 
uniformly required of all employees in the bargaining unit that are represented by 
the Union, shall be deemed to meet the conditions of this section.  

e. Employees of the bargaining unit that are represented by the Union shall be 
deemed to be in compliance with this Union Security Clause if they are not more 
than sixty (60) days in arrears in payment of membership dues, or the sum 
equivalent to membership dues as a charge for representation services.  

f. The Employer shall be notified in writing, by the Union, of any employees in 
the bargaining unit that are represented by the Union who are sixty (60) days in 
arrears in payment of membership dues, or the sum equivalent.  

g. The Union shall indemnify and save the Employer harmless from any and all 
claims, demands, suits, or any other action arising from this Article or from 
complying with any request for termination under this Article. 

ARTICLE 7 - UNION DUES, INITIATION FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES  

A. Payment by Checkoff  

15 - The Employer will check off initiation fees and biweekly dues, or service charges, 
on the basis of individually signed voluntary checkoff authorization cards on forms that 
have been agreed to by the Employer and the Union. Employees shall tender the 
initiation fee uniformly required as a condition of acquiring membership in the Union and 
biweekly membership dues, or service charges, by signing the proper authorization for 
checkoff form. Employees who are members of the Union must remain members for the 
duration of the Agreement.  

B. Employer Responsibility for Deductions  

16 - The Employer shall have no responsibility for the collection of initiation fees and 
membership dues, or service charges, or any other assessments that are not in 
accordance with the Union Security Clause of the Agreement.  

C. Delivery of Executed Authorizations for Checkoff  

17 - A properly executed copy of the form authorizing checkoff by an employee for 
whom initiation fees and biweekly membership dues, or service charges, are to be 
deducted in accordance with the Union Security Clause of the Agreement shall be 
delivered to the Employer before any payroll deductions are made. Deductions shall be 
made thereafter only under a properly executed authorization for checkoff which is in 
effect. Any authorization for checkoff form which is incomplete or in error will be 
returned to the Union Secretary-Treasurer by the Employer.  

D. When Deductions Begin  

18 - Deductions under all properly executed authorizations for checkoff shall become 
effective at the time such authorizations are tendered to the Employer and shall be 
deducted from the first (1st) pay of the month and biweekly thereafter.  

E. Refunds  

19 - In cases where a deduction is made that duplicates a payment that an employee 
already has made to the Union, or where a deduction is not in conformity with the 
provisions of the Union Constitution or By-Laws, refunds to the employee will be made 
by the Union.  

F. Remittance of Deductions to Secretary-Treasurer  

20 - Deductions for any calendar month shall be remitted to the designated Secretary-
Treasurer as soon as possible after the first pay of that month. The Employer shall 
furnish the designated financial officer, monthly, with a list of those for whom the Union 
has submitted signed forms authorizing checkoff, but for whom no deductions have 
been made. The Union will notify the Office of Employee Relations, in writing, regarding 
changes in designated Secretary-Treasurer and financial officer.  

G. Termination of Checkoff  

21 - An employee shall cease to be subject to checkoff deductions beginning with the 
month immediately following the month in which he/she signs a dues termination card at 
the Union office. The Union will be notified by the Employer of the names of such 
employees following the end of each month in which the termination took place.  

H. Disputes Concerning Checkoff  

22 - Any dispute between the Union and the Employer which may arise as to whether or 
not an employee properly executed or properly revoked an authorization for checkoff, 
shall be a proper subject for a special conference. Until the matter is disposed of, no 
further deductions shall be made.  

I. Limit of Employer's Liability  

23 - The Employer shall not be liable to the Union by reason of the requirements of this 
Agreement for the remittance or payment of any sum other than that constituting actual 
deductions made from wages earned by employees.  

J. List of Members Paying Dues or Service Charges Directly  

24 - The Union will furnish the Employer, within fifteen (15) days after the effective date 
of this Agreement, the names of all members paying dues or service charges directly to 
the Union. Thereafter, the Union will furnish the Employer a monthly list of any changes.  

K. Disputes Concerning Membership  

25 - Any dispute arising as to an employee's membership in the Union shall be reviewed 
by the designated representative of the Employer and a representative of the Union, 
and if not resolved, may be decided at Step III of the grievance procedure. However, the 
employee may be retained at work while the dispute is being resolved.  

26 - The Union shall indemnify and save the Employer harmless from any liability 
resulting from any and all claims, demands, suits or any other action arising from 

compliance with this Article, or in reliance on any list, notice, certification or 
authorization furnished under this Article.  

ARTICLE 8 - REPRESENTATION DISTRICTS  

27 - The number of representation districts in the unit shall be as shown in paragraph 
28, unless the number is increased or decreased by agreement between the Employer

ARTICLE 9 - STEWARDS AND ALTERNATE STEWARDS  

29 - In each district, employees in the district shall be represented by one District 
Steward or during his/her absence, an Alternate Steward, who shall be a regular 
employee and working in the district. The District Steward or Alternate Steward shall be 
notified in advance and in writing of scheduled overtime periods. Any concerns over the 

administration of this provision shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration 
procedure. The parties shall use the Special Conference provision to resolve concerns 
relative to this provision. During scheduled overtime periods for more than one 
employee in a district, if the District Steward or Alternate Steward is not scheduled to 
work in accordance with the equalization of overtime provision (Article 45) the District 
Steward or Alternate Steward shall appoint an employee scheduled to work as Acting 
Steward for that particular overtime period.  

30 - The District Stewards, during their working hours, without loss of time or pay shall, 
in their own district, in accordance with the terms of this section, investigate and present 
grievances to the Employer, upon having received permission from his/her Supervisor to 
do so. The Supervisor will normally grant permission and provide sufficient time to the 
District Stewards to leave their work for these purposes subject to necessary 
emergency exceptions. The privilege of District Stewards leaving their work during 
working hours without loss of time or pay is subject to the understanding the time will be 
devoted to the proper handling of grievances and will not be abused; and District 
Stewards will perform their regularly assigned work at all times, except when necessary 
to leave their work to handle grievances as provided herein. One (1) District Steward or 
one (1) Alternate Steward and one (1) executive board member will be excused with 
pay to attend one (1) regularly scheduled stewards or executive board meeting not to 
exceed two (2) hours per month. Any alleged abuse by either party will be a proper 
subject for a Special Conference.  

31 - A Chief Steward, or in his/her absence a designated Alternate Chief Steward, may 
investigate and discuss grievances with District Supervisors and/or District Stewards. 
The Chief Steward, or in his/her absence a designated Alternate Chief Steward, may 
leave his/her work during working hours without loss of pay based on the understanding 
that his/her Supervisor has granted him/her permission to leave his/her work, that the 
time will be devoted to the prompt handling of legitimate grievances, and that he/she will 
perform his/her regularly assigned work at all times except when necessary to leave 
his/her work to handle grievances as provided herein. Any alleged abuse by either party 
will be a proper subject for a Special Conference.  

32 - The Union will furnish the Office of Employee Relations with the names of its 
authorized representatives and members of its grievance committees, and such 
changes as may occur from time to time in such personnel, so that the Employer may at 
all times be advised as to the authority of the individual representatives of the Union 
with which it may be dealing. The Employer will, in return, keep the Union advised as to 
its representatives.  

ARTICLE 10 - UNION BULLETIN BOARD  

33 - The Employer will provide enclosed bulletin boards that may be locked in each 
district which may be used by the Union for posting notices of the following types:  

a. Notices of Union educational, recreational and social events.  

b. Notices of Union elections.  

c.  Notices of results of Union elections.  

d. Notices of Union meetings.  

e. Notices of job openings. 

34 - The Union shall have the exclusive right to the use of its assigned bulletin boards. 
In the event a dispute arises concerning the appropriateness of material posted on the 
Union Bulletin Boards, the President of the local Union will be advised by the Office of 
Employee Relations of the nature of the dispute and the notices or bulletins in question 
will be removed from the bulletin boards until the dispute is resolved.  

ARTICLE 11 - SENIORITY DEFINED  

35 - Seniority shall be on a bargaining unit-wide basis in accordance with the 
employee's last date of hire in Local 999 unless negotiated locally by occupational 
groups.  

36 - "Length of continuous service" means uninterrupted employment with the 
University, but includes layoffs and other periods of absence authorized by and 
consistent with this Agreement except as limited by the section designated as "Loss of 
Seniority," Article 14 of this Agreement.  

ARTICLE 12 - SENIORITY  

A. Probationary Employees  

37 - New employees hired in the unit shall be considered as probationary employees for 
the first 1040 hours of work. When an employee finishes the probationary period, 
he/she shall be entered on the seniority list of the occupational group and shall rank for 
seniority from the date the probationary period began. There shall be no seniority 
among probationary employees.  

38 - The Union shall represent probationary employees for the purposes of collective 
bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and other conditions 
of employment, except discharge or discipline for reasons other than Union activity.  

B. Part-time Employees  

39 - Employees regularly scheduled to work twenty (20) hours per week but less than 
twenty-six (26) hours per week shall be considered half-time (1/2) time employees; 
those regularly scheduled to work more than twenty-six (26) hours per week but less 
than thirty-six (36) hours per week shall be considered three-quarter (3/4) time 
employees; and those regularly scheduled to work thirty-six (36) hours per week to forty 
(40) hours per week shall be considered full-time employees.  

40 - Benefits to part-time employees - The following benefits shall be extended to part-
time employees on a proportional basis: vacation time, holidays, personal leave, sick 
leave, longevity, funeral leave, health, dental, employee paid life, accidental death and 
dismemberment, and retirement contribution if the employee participates. (See 
definition of proportional benefits.)  

41 - Seniority - Part-time employees shall retain seniority on the same basis as full-time 
employees. This seniority shall be exercised during periods of layoffs, recall, and for 
filling of vacancies.  

ARTICLE 13 - SENIORITY LISTS  

42 - The seniority lists on the date of this Agreement will show the names of all 
employees of the unit entitled to a ranking for seniority. Service records in effect at the 
date of this agreement shall be used by the parties hereto as the records of continuous 
service as of such date.  

43 - The Employer will keep the seniority lists up to date at all times, and whenever a 
Steward shall raise a question of seniority, shall make the seniority list available for 
his/her inspection for the purpose of settling the question. The Employer will, if 
requested by the Union, post corrected seniority lists every three (3) months.  

44 - Within thirty (30) days after the ratification of this Agreement and every three (3) 
months thereafter during the term of this Agreement, the Employer shall give to the 
Union the names of all Union members covered by the Agreement together with their 
addresses as they then appear on the records of the Employer. The Union shall receive 
and retain such information in confidence and shall disclose it only to those officials of 
the Union whose Union duties require them to have such information.  

ARTICLE 14 - LOSS OF SENIORITY  

45 - An employee shall lose his/her status as an employee and his/her seniority if:  

a. He/She resigns or quits.  

b. He/She is discharged or terminated (unless reversed through the grievance or 
arbitration procedures).  

c. He/She retires.  

d. He/She does not return to work from layoff within fourteen calendar days after 
having been notified to return by restricted certified or registered mail addressed 
to the employee at his/her last address filed with the Office of Human Resource 
Services except when failure to notify and work is due to circumstances beyond 
the control of the employee. An employee who changes address must notify the 
Employer of the change.  

e. He/She has been on layoff for a period of time equal to his/her unit seniority at 
the time of his/her layoff or two (2) years, whichever is lesser.  

f. He/She is absent from work, including the failure to return to work at the 
expiration of a leave of absence, vacation, or disciplinary layoff, for three (3) 
consecutive working days without notifying the Employer, except when the 
failure to notify and work is due to circumstances beyond the control of the 
employee. 

46 - A grievance involving compliance with this section shall begin at Step Three of the 
Grievance Procedure.  

ARTICLE 15 - SENIORITY OF STEWARDS  

47 - Notwithstanding their position on the seniority list, Stewards shall in the event of a 
layoff of any type be continued at work as long as there is work in their district which 
they can perform and shall be recalled to work in the event of a layoff to the first 
vacancy in their district which they can perform.  

ARTICLE 16 - SENIORITY OF OFFICERS  

48 - Notwithstanding their position on the seniority list, the President, Vice President, 
Financial Secretary, Recording Secretary and Chief Steward of the Union shall, in the 
event of a layoff only, be continued to work at all times when one or more districts or 
divisions or fractions thereof are at work, provided they can perform any of the work 
available.  

ARTICLE 17 - SHIFT PREFERENCE  

49 - Shift preference will be granted on the basis of seniority within the classification as 
openings occur. The transfer to the desired shift will be effected within two (2) weeks 
following the end of the current pay period within which a written request is made, 
provided the employee can do the work.  

ARTICLE 18 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE  

A. Time of Answers  

50 - The Employer will answer in writing any grievance presented to it in writing by the 
Union as indicated below, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement:  

a. By the District Supervisor within five (5) working days from the date of the 
meeting at which the grievance was discussed.  

b. By the Administrative Head of a unit or division within seven (7) working days 
from the date of the meeting at which the grievance was discussed.  

c. By the Director of Employee Relations or his/her designated representative 
within seven (7) working days from the date of the meeting at which the 
grievance was discussed.  

d. The grievance must be presented in writing by the Chief Steward to the 
Administrative Head of a unit or division within fifteen (15) working days after its 
occurrence, except as provided for in Paragraph 67, in order to be a proper 
matter for the grievance procedure. 

B. Time of Appeals  

51 - Any grievance not appealed from an answer at Step II of the grievance procedure 
to Step III of the grievance procedure within seven (7) working days after such answer 
shall be considered settled on the basis of the last answer and not subject to further 
review.  

52 - A grievance may be withdrawn without prejudice, and, if so withdrawn, all financial 
liabilities shall be cancelled. If the grievance is reinstated, the financial liability shall date 
only from the date of reinstatement. If the grievance is not reinstated within three (3) 
months from the date of withdrawal, the grievance shall not be reinstated. Where one or 
more grievances involve a similar issue, those grievances may be withdrawn without 
prejudice pending the disposition of the appeal of a representative case. In such event, 
the withdrawal without prejudice will not affect financial liability.  

ARTICLE 19 - PRESENTING A GRIEVANCE  

53 - Any employee having a grievance in connection with his/her employment shall 
present it to the Employer as follows:  

A. Oral Step  

54 - If an employee feels he/she has a grievance and wishes to enter it into the 
grievance procedure, he/she may discuss it with his/her Immediate Supervisor, or with 
his/her District Steward, who must then discuss it with the employee's immediate 
Supervisor before the grievance is referred to the District Supervisor. The Chief Steward 
may be present at any step or steps of the Grievance Procedure as well as an 
additional representative of the Employer, and if the Employer, requests that the 
aggrieved employee be present at any step or steps of the Grievance Procedure to 
participate in the discussion, he/she will be required to do so.  

55 - If the matter is thereby not resolved, the District Steward may discuss the grievance 
with the District Supervisor on his/her shift. In the absence of a District Supervisor on 
his/her shift, the District Steward may refer the grievance to the appropriate day shift 
District Steward who may discuss the matter with the District Supervisor.  

B. Step I  

56 - If the grievance is not resolved, the District Steward may reduce the grievance to 
writing and submit it to the District Supervisor on his/her shift. The grievance shall be 
dated and signed by the aggrieved employee and his/her District Steward and shall set 
forth the facts, including dates, and provisions of the Agreement that are alleged to have 
been violated and the remedy desired. The grievance shall not be considered submitted 
until the District Supervisor receives the written grievance. A meeting will be arranged 
between the District Steward and the District supervisor to discuss the grievance. The 
District Supervisor will then answer the grievance in writing.  

C. Step II  

57 - If the grievance is not resolved, the District Steward may refer the grievance to the 
Chief Steward who may submit it to the Administrative Head, or his/her designated 
representative of the unit or division, indicating the reasons why the written answer of 
the District Supervisor was unsatisfactory. The grievance shall not be considered 
submitted until the Administrative Head, or his/her designated representative, receives 
the written grievance. A meeting will be scheduled, within ten (10) working days from 
the date on which the written grievance was submitted, between the Chief Steward, 
District Steward and the representatives designated by the Employer to discuss the 

grievance. The Administrative Head, or his/her designated representative, will then 
answer the grievance in writing.  

D. Step III  

58 - If the Administrative Head's answer is not satisfactory, the grievance may be 
referred to the Union President who may submit his/her appeal to the Employer's 
designated representative indicating the reasons why the written answer of the 
Administrative Head was unsatisfactory. Within ten (10) working days after receipt of 
such appeal, a meeting between no more than three (3) representatives of the Union 
and three (3) representatives designated by the Employer will be scheduled to discuss 
the grievance.  

59 - The Union representatives may meet at a place designated by the Employer on the 
Employer's property for at least one-half (1/2) hour immediately preceding a meeting 
with the representatives of the Employer for which a written request has been made.  

60 - The Union President or his/her representative shall be allowed time off his/her job 
without loss of pay to investigate a grievance he/she is to discuss or has discussed with 
the Employer, upon having received permission from his/her Supervisor to do so. The 
Supervisor will normally grant permission and provide sufficient time to the Union 
President or his/her representative to leave his/her work for these purposes subject to 
necessary emergency exceptions. The privilege of the Union President or his/her 
representative leaving his/her work during working hours without loss of time or pay is 
subject to the understanding that the time will be devoted to the proper handling of 
grievances and will not be abused; and the Union President or his/her representative 
will perform his/her regularly assigned work at all times, except when necessary to leave 
his/her work to handle grievances as provided herein. The Union President or his/her 
representative shall schedule this time within the release time provided in Article 35 
unless additional time is authorized by the Office of Employee Relations. Any alleged 
abuse by either party will be a proper subject for a Special Conference.  

E. Step IV  

61 - In the event the Office of Employee Relations' answer is not satisfactory, settlement 
may be determined by decision of the Arbitrator selected by the parties. The Union 
President or the Employer shall within thirty (30) calendar days of the Step III answer 
notify the other party or his designated representative in writing that they wish to appeal 
the grievance to arbitration. In the event they cannot agree upon an Arbitrator within five 
(5) working days of the date of the appeal, the party appealing the grievance to 
arbitration shall within fifteen (15) working days thereafter file a Demand for Arbitration 
with the American Arbitration Association who shall select an Arbitrator and the 

Arbitrator shall establish a hearing date. In the event either party fails to appeal the 
grievance to arbitration within the specified time limit or the appealing party fails to file 
the Demand for Arbitration within the specified time limit, the grievance shall be 
considered settled based upon the last answer by the Employer's designated 
representative. The fees and approved expenses of the Arbitrator will be paid by the 
parties equally. The rules of the American Arbitration Association shall apply to all 
Arbitration hearings.  

62 - Grievances within the meaning of the grievance procedure and this arbitration 
clause shall consist only of disputes about the interpretation or alleged violations of the 
Agreement. The Arbitrator shall have no power to add to, or subtract from, or modify 
any of the terms of this Agreement, nor shall he/she substitute his/her discretion for that 
of the Employer or the Union where such discretion has been retained by the Employer 
or the Union, nor shall he/she exercise any responsibility or function of the Employer or 
the Union.  

63 - Finality of Decisions: There shall be no appeal from the Arbitrator's decision. Each 
such decision shall be final, and binding upon the Union and its members, the employee 
or employees involved, and the Employer. The Union will discourage any attempt of its 
members and will not encourage or cooperate with any of its members in any appeal to 
any Court or Labor Board from a decision of the Arbitrator.  

ARTICLE 20 - COMPUTATION OF BACK WAGES  

64 - No claim for back wages shall exceed the amount of wages the employee would 
otherwise have earned at his/her regular rate of pay.  

ARTICLE 21 - REPRIMAND, SUSPENSION OR DISCHARGE  

65 - In the event of written reprimand, suspension or discharge the employee may 
request that the Steward of the District and/or the Chief Steward be present. The 
Employer will make available an area where the employee may discuss a suspension or 
discharge before he/she is required to leave the property of the Employer.  

A. Notice  

66 - The Employer agrees, upon the written reprimand, suspension or discharge of any 
employee, to notify promptly in writing the Steward in the district and a copy shall be 
mailed to the Union President. In the event that an employee is issued a verbal warning, 
there will be no "Notice of Non-Academic Disciplinary Action - Written Record of Verbal 
Warning" prepared.  

B. Appeal  

67 - Should the reprimanded, suspended, or discharged employee and the Steward 
consider the discipline to be excessive and without just cause, a grievance shall be 
submitted within five (5) regularly scheduled work days of the reprimand, suspension or 
discharge. A grievance over a reprimand shall be submitted by the Chief Steward to the 
Administrative Head (Step II), whereas a grievance over a suspension or discharge 
shall be submitted by the Union President to the Office of Employee Relations (Step III). 
The Office of Employee Relations will schedule a meeting with the Union within three (3) 
regularly scheduled working days from the receipt of the appeal and shall, within two (2) 
regularly scheduled working days after said meeting, provide the Union with a written 
answer to the appeal. Failure to submit a written grievance within the time limits shall 
constitute a waiver of all claims concerning such reprimand, suspension, or discharge.  

C. Use of Past Record  

68 - In imposing any discipline on a current charge, the Employer will not take into 
account any prior infractions of which the Employer had knowledge, that occurred more 
than two (2) years previously.  

ARTICLE 22 - MEDICAL DISPUTE  

69 - In the event of a dispute involving any employee's physical ability to perform his/her 
job on his/her return to work at the University from a layoff or leave of absence of any 
kind, when the employee is not satisfied with the determination of the University's 
physician, he/she may submit a report from a medical doctor of his/her own choosing 
and at his/her own expense. If the dispute still exists, at the request of the Union, within 
2 working days, the University's physician and the employee's physician shall agree 
upon a third medical doctor to submit a report to the Employer and the employee, and 
the decision of such third party will be binding on both parties. The expense of the 
report of the third party shall be shared equally by the Employer and the employee. The 
prevailing determination will be effective at a date mutually agreed to by the Union and 
the University.  

ARTICLE 23 -TEMPORARY LAYOFFS  

70 - Due to vacation periods and conditions beyond the Employer's control, adjustments 
of the work force can be made without application of the layoff procedure of this 
Agreement. If such temporary adjustment continues for more than ten (10) working 
days, the Union can request the Employer to adjust the working force according to the 
layoff provision of the Agreement and the Employer will do so within five (5) working 
days thereafter.  

ARTICLE 24 - LAYOFFS  

71 - When there is a decrease in the work force, the following procedure shall be 
followed: temporary and probationary employees will be laid off within the affected 
classification, provided the seniority employees can do the available work.  

72 - Seniority employees will be laid off according to unit seniority, within the affected 
classification, provided the greater seniority employees are able to perform the available 
work. However, the Employer shall not be required to promote an employee at time of 
layoffs, unless he/she has previously performed the higher-rated job and is able to do 
the work.  

73 - A seniority employee laid off as provided for in Paragraph 72 may then bump a less 
senior employee in another classification in the same pay grade, within the same 
occupational group, provided he/she has the ability to perform the available work and so 
on to classifications in lower pay grades, providing he/she has the ability to perform the 
available work.  

a. Where there is a dispute over ability to do the work the employee shall, prior 
to the layoff date and with documentation of prior education and/or experience 
applicable to the position and satisfactory to the Employer, be given one trial 
period of up to 10 working days in which to demonstrate competency to fill that 
position.  

b. The phrase "satisfactory to the Employer" shall mean the Employer may make 
an initial determination as to an employee's prior education and/or experience 
being applicable to the available position. If a dispute exists over the Employer's 
initial determination, the factual applicability of prior education and/or experience 
to the position shall be determined through the grievance procedure.  

c. A seniority employee who is given notice of layoff and after exhausting all 
available bump options within her/his occupational group without success, will be 
eligible to exercise the following option. The employee may bump the Trades 
Helper with the least seniority in another occupational group if she/he can 
perform the duties performed by the employee subject to the bump. If the 
Employer determines that the employee cannot satisfactorily perform the duties 
of a Trades Helper I, that determination will be grievable under Article 19 of the 
Agreement. If the position to be bumped is that of a Trades Helper II and the 
employee is determined not to be able to perform the duties, a grievance may be 
filed and processed through the first three steps of the grievance procedure. 
However, the grievance shall not be appealable to step IV of the grievance 
procedure, which is arbitration. 

74 - Employees to be laid off for an indefinite period of time will have at least fourteen 
(14) calendar days notice of layoff. The local Union Secretary and the District Steward 
will receive a list from the Employer of the employees being laid off on the same date 
the notices are issued to the employees.  

75 - Unless otherwise specifically provided for by this Agreement, seniority shall 
accumulate during layoffs. Provided however, that during a layoff, an employee will not 
accrue vacation or sick leave nor be eligible for any payments for time off work provided 
by this Agreement, except as otherwise provided for by this Agreement.  

76 - In the event of a dispute over a senior employee's ability to do the work as 
described in paragraphs 71, 72, and 73, the Union may file a grievance at Step 2 of the 
grievance procedure.  

ARTICLE 25 - ASSIGNMENT OF SKILLED TRADES EMPLOYEES  

77 - Employees covered by this Agreement may be assigned to other tasks during 
certain times without an increase or decrease in their regular rate of pay because of 
lack of available work in their specific classification. Should the need for a temporary 
reassignment arise, it will be handled in the following manner.  

a. The Employer will ask for volunteers from the affected classification who 
would be willing to be reassigned on a temporary basis.  

b. Should there be an insufficient number of volunteers, the requisite number of 
employees will be reassigned based on the least senior employees within the 
classification who can perform the work to be assigned.  

c. If there is a dispute as to whether the least senior employee can perform the 
work, the Union may call for a special conference which must be held before the 
employee is reassigned. 

78 - The Employer will make every effort to give reasonable notice to employees who 
are to be temporarily assigned.  

79 - It is understood that the above provision does not guarantee twelve months 
employment each year to any employee but is merely a sincere effort on the part of the 
Employer to utilize the talents and services of regular full-time employees during 
normally slow periods.  

ARTICLE 26 - RECALL PROCEDURE  

80 - When the working force is increased after a layoff, employees will be recalled 
according to unit seniority in the classification provided the greater seniority employees 
are able to perform the available work. However, the Employer shall not be required to 
promote an employee at time of recall unless he/she has previously performed the 
higher-rated job and is able to do the work.  

81 - Seniority of an employee who is reemployed from a seniority list in the same 
occupational group that he/she was laid off from shall have status restored as of the 
date he/she left the service of the Employer.  

82 - Notice of recall shall be sent to the employee at his/her last known address by 
registered or certified mail. A copy of the notice of recall will be mailed to the Union 
President and another copy will be placed in the Union's mailbox at the Office of 
Employee Relations. If an employee fails to report for work within fourteen (14) calendar 
days from the date of mailing the notice of recall, it shall be considered a voluntary 
termination.  

ARTICLE 27 - WORK OPPORTUNITY FOR LAID-OFF EMPLOYEES  

83 - The Employer will, in employing new people in any occupational group, give work 
opportunity bargaining unit-wide to employees with seniority who are at the time laid off 
and are not expected to be returned to work in their classification, and who can perform 
the work of the vacant position.  

84 - An employee with seniority who is laid off and given work in another occupational 
group will be given seniority in the new occupational group equivalent to that which 
he/she had accrued in the occupational group from which he/she was laid off.  

85 - The laid off employee shall retain seniority rights in his/her former occupational 
group until his/her accrued seniority in his/her new occupational group equals the 
seniority he/she had in his/her former occupational group at which time all of his/her 
seniority in his/her former occupational group shall be cancelled. If the employee 
exercises his/her seniority rights and returns to his/her former occupational group prior 
to the cancellation of seniority, he/she shall do so with all accumulated seniority.  

ARTICLE 28 - ABSENCES  

86 - An employee is expected not to be absent from work for any reason other than 
personal illness without making prior arrangements before the start of the shift with the 
supervisor. Unless such prior arrangements are made, notice must be given to the 
supervisor immediately of the reason for being absent. If the absence is to continue 
beyond the first day, the supervisor must be notified on a daily basis, unless otherwise 

arranged with and specifically approved by the supervisor. The employee is responsible 
to notify the supervisor in situations as described above. When notice is provided by 
someone other than the employee, the employee will be held accountable for the 
message and the receipt of the supervisor's response. Each employee will be given a 
telephone number in order to notify their supervisor if they are going to be absent. If a 
dispute arises as to whether the employee contacted the supervisor, in the first dispute, 
the employee will be given the benefit of the doubt.  

ARTICLE 29 - HOLIDAY PROVISIONS  

87 - The paid holidays are designated as:

work on this day or on a scheduled day off in the employee's work week and no other 
day is observed as a holiday by the Employer, the employee will receive an alternate 
day off with pay, the time to be arranged with his/her Supervisor. Whenever one of the 
above holidays falls on Sunday, the following Monday shall be observed as the 
designated holiday, except for the day before or after Christmas and the day before or 
after New Year's which shall be considered separately each year.  

89 - If an employee is absent on either his/her scheduled working day immediately 
preceding or his/her scheduled working day immediately following the holiday, he/she 
will not be paid for the holiday unless his/her absence is excused. However, if an 
employee is laid off for the period between the end of fall semester and the beginning of 
spring semester because of lack of work, he/she will receive the same holiday pay given 
to the rest of the employees.  

90 - If an employee terminates his/her employment, he/she will not receive pay for 
holidays occurring after the last day worked even though the holidays may fall within the 
period of his/her projected terminal vacation leave (except when an employee retires).

rate of pay for hours worked on a holiday.  

93 - An employee who is on vacation or sickness and disability leave with pay when a 
holiday occurs will be paid for the holiday and no charge will be made against accrued 
vacation or sick leave credits.

University designated holidays which may fall within the terminal vacation period.  

100 - An approved leave of absence for military service will not be counted as a break in

progressive vacation plan. All other leaves of absence will be considered a break in an 
employee's service record in determining vacation allowances.  

101 - An employee may take his/her vacation at any time in the course of the year as

149 - All requests for leaves of absence shall be made with the employee's immediate 
supervisor.  

ARTICLE 39 - FILLING OF VACANCIES  

150 - The Employer will fill vacancies on a seniority basis first within the occupational 
group with employees who possess the minimum qualifications for the classification 
under consideration. If there are no qualified bidders or no bidders from within the 
occupational group, the Employer will select the most senior applicant in the bargaining 
unit who possesses the minimum qualifications of the classification. An unsatisfactory 
MSU employment record may be a proper per cause for denial of consideration for a 
vacancy.  

151 - Vacancies will be posted for a period of seven (7) calendar days in a conspicuous 
place in the employee's work areas. All postings will state the classification, rate of pay, 
starting time, shift, location, and minimum qualifications. A copy of the Position Vacancy 
Notice will be provided to the Union when it is available. Employees must apply for 
vacancies by submitting the Employee Request for Consideration for Support Staff 
Position Vacancy to the Office of Human Resource Services by the closing date 
specified on the Position Vacancy Notice.  

152 - Postings shall remain posted for seven (7) calendar days before the vacancy is 
filled. The Employer will notify the Union, in writing, of the name of the employee 
selected to fill a vacancy, stating his/her seniority date and title of the classification. 
Temporary transfers may be used, if necessary, during the posting period.  

153 - A vacancy may not be filled from a posting ninety (90) calendar days or more after 
the posting expiration date. The vacancy must be reposted if it is to be filled.  

154 - If it should become necessary in filling a vacancy to bypass an employee's 
seniority, reasons for denial shall be given in writing to such employee with a copy to 
the Steward of the district.  

155 - An employee who is promoted, transferred or demoted must satisfactorily 
complete a trial period of 520 hours of work. Prior to the expiration of this period, either 
the Employer or the employee may declare the trial period unsatisfactory, and the 
employee shall return to his/her former position at his/her former pay rate, classification, 
and shift. If the Employer determines an employee is unsatisfactory in the new position, 

notice and reasons shall be submitted to the employee in writing by the Employer with a 
copy to the Union. The matter may then become a proper subject for the grievance 
procedure.  

156 - During the trial period, employees will receive the regular rate of the job they are 
performing.  

157 - An employee who bids on a vacancy that is posted under this section and is 
subsequently selected and placed in the vacancy shall remain assigned to it for three 
(3) months following the 520 hours of work trial period before becoming eligible to bid 
on another posted vacancy.  

158 - If an employee is temporarily assigned to a job with a higher maximum rate, and 
he/she is capable of doing the job, he/she shall receive an increase of ten (10) cents per 
hour, or the starting rate, whichever is greater, but in no event shall he/she be paid 
more than the maximum rate of the job to which he/she is temporarily assigned. If the 
temporary assignment in a higher classification is for three (3) hours or more, the 
employee will receive the increase in pay for eight (8) hours. An employee who is 
assigned on a temporary basis to a job in a lower pay grade shall have his/her hourly 
pay rate maintained. This section shall not be used to circumvent the posting 
requirement as stated in this article.  

159 - If an employee is temporarily assigned to work as a supervisor for eight (8) 
consecutive hours or more, he/she shall receive, in addition to his/her regular pay, one 
dollar ($1.00) per hour differential compensation. Such differential compensation will not 
increase the hourly base rate.  

160 - The procedures for filling vacancies may be bypassed for the following situations:  

a. Employees drawing Workers' Compensation benefits for any position at their 
former or lower compensation grade levels, the duties of which they are able to 
perform, provided that during their absence they did not become subject to 
layoff.  

b. Former seniority employees who have filed for unemployment compensation. 

161 - The parties recognize the Employer's commitment to and program for Affirmative 
Action. To that end the parties agree to cooperate to the extent possible for the 
achievement of the Affirmative Action objective. When it is necessary to fill vacancies 
for Affirmative action purposes, such action must be proven under the provision of the 
Affirmative action plan of the Employer. The University and the Union will meet to 

discuss any problems associated with the filling of vacancies for affirmative action 
purposes. Following discussion, the action may be permitted.  

ARTICLE 40 - TRANSFERS  

162 - Transfer of Employees: If an employee with seniority is transferred from one 
occupational group to another occupational group, he/she will be given seniority in the 
new occupational group equivalent to that which he/she had accrued in the occupational 
group from which he/she is transferred at which time all of his/her seniority in his/her 
former occupational group shall be cancelled.  

163 - Effective July 1, 1975, an employee who is thereinafter transferred to a position 
under the Employer, not included in Local 999, shall accumulate seniority for the first 
180 days provided he/she returns to a Local 999 position during the said 180 day 
period. In the event the employee returns to a position in Local 999 after the initial 180 
day period, his/her seniority shall have been frozen as of the date he/she transferred out 
of Local 999 and shall accumulate additional seniority beginning on the date he/she 
returns to a position in Local 999.  

164 - Employees transferring under the above circumstances, TRANSFERS 
Paragraphs 162 and 163 shall retain all rights accrued for the purposes of any fringe 
benefits provided for in this Agreement.  

165 - If and when operations or divisions or fractions thereof are transferred from one 
location to another for a period of more than seven (7) calendar days, employees 
affected will be given the opportunity to transfer on the basis of seniority, desire and 
classification. Location exchange will be considered in such cases.  

166 - The Employer agrees that in any movement of work not covered above in 
TRANSFERS Paragraphs 162, 163, and 165, he/she will discuss the movements with 
the Union in order to provide for the protection of the seniority of the employees 
involved.  

ARTICLE 41 - CLASSIFICATION AND WAGES  

167 - Wages shall be paid in accordance with the Wage Schedule as set forth in 
Appendixes III, IV and V. All listed classifications and corresponding wage rates shall 
remain in effect for the term of the Agreement unless the job content of any 
classification is changed.  

168 - The Employer retains the right to eliminate, change and establish classifications. 
In the event a new classification is established or an existing classification is changed, 

the Employer shall place it in an existing pay grade in the Wage Schedule or in a new 
pay grade, on the basis of the relative value of the elements of the new or changed 
classification in comparison with the elements of existing classifications.  

169 - The following procedure will be used whenever a new or changed classification is 
placed in the Wage Schedule, as provided in Paragraph 168 of this article.  

a. The Employer will provide the Union with a written copy of the new or 
changed classification which shall describe the job content sufficiently to identify 
the classification.  

b. Upon receipt of the Employer's classification description, a reasonable 
number of representatives of the Union may meet with representatives of the 
Employer to discuss the new or changed classification and the placement in the 
Wage Schedule.  

c. If there is a disagreement with the placement in the Wage Schedule, a 
grievance concerning compliance with Paragraph 168 of this article may be 
processed through the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure, provided it is 
submitted in writing at Step III of the Grievance Procedure within seven (7) 
working days after the Union is afforded the opportunity to discuss the matter 
with the Employer. If such a grievance is processed through Arbitration, the 
Arbitrator shall have no power or authority to revise the classification, but only to 
determine whether the proper placement has been made in the Wage Schedule 
in accordance with Paragraph 168 of this article. 

ARTICLE 42 - WAGE RATE INCREASE PLAN  

A. Wage Rate  

170 - Effective July 1, 1999, the minimum and maximum of each grade level shall be 
adjusted as reflected in Appendix III. Each employee on the active payroll on that date 
shall have his/her base rate of pay increased by three (3) percent.  

171 - Effective July 1, 2000, the minimum and maximum of each grade level shall be 
adjusted as reflected in Appendix IV. Each employee on the active payroll on that date 
shall have his/her base rate of pay increased by three (3) percent.  

172 - Effective July 1, 2001, the minimum and maximum of each grade level shall be

as of June 30, 2001 as a one-time payment. Payment shall be made during the month 
of July, 2001.  

B. Movement Within Grade Levels  

173 - Effective July 1, 1975, a review will be made of all employees, except 
Apprentices, represented by Local 999 whose wage rate is not at the maximum of their 
current grade level. If an employee meets the following qualifications:  

a. Has been in their present classification for two (2) years or more.  

b. Has at least a satisfactory rating on each of their last two (2) Employee 
Evaluation rating form, that employee will receive an increase to bring their wage 
rate to the maximum of their current grade level. 

During the term of this Agreement, an employee whose wage rate is not at the 
maximum of their current grade level and who does not meet the qualifications as listed 
above, shall be:  

a. Reviewed on a semiannual basis and will be granted an increase based upon 
a satisfactory work record. Employees shall progress to the top of their current

the date of qualifications, receive an increase to bring their wage rate to the 
maximum of their current grade level. 

A written record of the date and the outcome of the review will be made.  

In no case will an increase exceed the maximum rate for the classification.  

ARTICLE 43 - WORKING HOURS  

A. Shift Differential  

174 - Employees who work on the second or third shift shall receive, in addition to their 
regular pay fifty (50) cents per hour additional compensation. Such differential is to be

hours worked on a shift.  

B. Shift Hours  

175 - The first shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 5:00 a.m., but before 1:00 
p.m. The second shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 1:00 p.m. but before 
9:00 p.m. The third shift is any shift that regularly starts on or after 9:00 p.m. but before 
5:00 a.m.  

C. Rest Periods  

176 - Employees may take a rest period of not more than fifteen (15) minutes for each 
half day of work. Rest periods should be taken at a time and in a manner that does not 
interfere with the efficiency of the work unit. The rest period is intended to be a recess to 
be preceded and followed by an extended work period; thus, it may not be used to 
cover an employee's late arrival to work or early departure, nor may it be regarded as 
accumulative if not taken.  

D. Wash-Up Time  

177 - Employees will be given the necessary time prior to punching out, to wash up and 
change uniforms, if used.  

E. Call-In Pay  

178 - An employee reporting for emergency duty at the Employer's request for work 
which he/she had not been notified of in advance and which is outside of and not 
continuous with his/her regular work period, shall be guaranteed at least three (3) hours 
pay and three (3) hours work at the rate of time-and one-half. An employee who reports 
for such emergency duty in the physical plant division which is of a minimum five (5) 
hours duration and which is continuous with his/her scheduled start time, shall receive a 
one (1) hour paid break prior to beginning scheduled work. An employee who reports for 
scheduled work and no work is available will receive three (3) hours pay at his/her 
regular straight time rate. Paragraph 178, Call-in Pay shall apply when an employee is 
contacted away from the workplace for unscheduled emergency duty. An employee 
contacted away from the work place and who begins work within three (3) hours of a 
regular shift starting time shall receive the full three hours call-in pay at time-and-one-
half.  

When an employee has arrived at the workplace for a regularly scheduled shift and is 
then assigned to begin work early, Paragraph 178 does not apply. If the employee is 
assigned to begin work early also completes the regular schedule of work in accordance 
with Paragraph 179 or Paragraph 182a, then the employee will be paid for actual time 
worked before the start of the regular shift at time-and-one-half, or a one-half-hour 
minimum at time-and-one-half, whichever is greater.  

F. Time-and One-Half  

179 - Time-and-one-half the regular rate of pay will be paid for all time worked in excess 
of eight (8) hours in an employee's work day. Time-and-one-half the regular rate of pay

week.  

180 - For the purpose of computing overtime pay all hours paid will be considered time 
worked.  

181 - Overtime premium shall not be pyramided, compounded or paid twice for the 
same time worked.

SPECIFIC AREAS OF WORK  

182 - The following provisions apply to seven-day operations and other specific areas of 
work within the work groups designated.  

a. Time-and-one-half the regular straight time rate will be paid to employees 
assigned to seven-day operations who work over forty (40) hours in a work 
week. It is further agreed that the above provision applies to the Swing Shift 
Maintenance Shop Trouble Trucks within the Physical Plant.  

b. Time-and-one-half the regular straight time rate will be paid to all employees 
classified in the bargaining unit in the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics who 
work over forty (40) hours in a work week. 

ARTICLE 45 - EQUALIZATION OF OVERTIME HOURS  

183 - Overtime hours shall be divided as equally as practicable among employees in the 
same classifications in their district. An up-to-date list showing overtime hours will be 
posted in a prominent place in each district before the 15th of each month. Within the 
Physical Plant, overtime hours shall be divided as equally as practicable among 
employees in the same system numbers.  

184 - Whenever overtime is required, the person with the least number of overtime 
hours capable of performing the work reporting to that supervisor or, in the Physical 
Plant, within the same system number, will, except in necessary emergencies, be called 
first and so on down the list of those reporting to that supervisor or, in the Physical Plant 
within the same system number, in an attempt to equalize the overtime hours. The 
Union reserves the right to grieve what is an emergency. Employees reporting to other 

supervisors, or, in the Physical Plant, in other system numbers, may be called if there is 
a shortage of qualified employees reporting to the supervisor or the system number 
requiring the overtime. In such cases, they would be called on the basis of least hours 
of overtime, provided they are capable of performing the work.  

The Parties recognize in various units there are exceptions to the above procedure. 
Where currently exists, Project Teams groups, Service Routes and Subgroups, the 
following procedure will be followed:  

Employees regularly assigned to a Team Project, Service Route or Subgroup 
will be given the first opportunity to work the overtime. If there is not a sufficient 
number of employees from the Project Team, Service Route or Subgroup to 
perform the overtime work, the Supervisor will then go to the employees within 
that system number or reporting to that Supervisor. 

185 - For the purpose of this clause, an employee who did not choose to work will be 
charged the average number of overtime hours of the employees working during that 
overtime period (2 hour minimum). In the event of emergency call-in, only the person or 
persons actually contacted or report to perform the work will be charged the time. An 
employee who is unavailable will not be called for overtime work and will not be charged 
overtime hours.  

186 - On July 1 each year, the amount of overtime hours credited to each employee will 
be reduced equal to the amount of overtime hours credited to the employee at the 
bottom of the overtime list and only the excess overtime hours for each employee shall 
be carried forward.  

187 - Employees who have changed classifications will be charged with the highest 
number of overtime hours that exist in the new classifications on the day he/she was 
reclassified. Employees who, by reason of assignment change supervisors or, in the 
Physical Plant, system number, will carry their existing number of overtime hours with 
them to the new overtime list. New and transfer employees shall be given the same 
number of overtime hours as the employee with the highest number of hours on the 
overtime list, plus one hour.  

188 - The University and AFSCME, Local 999, AFL-CIO mutually agree that there are 
peak periods and times of unanticipated demands in University Printing when the 
University must carry out its operations on an overtime basis. The peak periods in 
University Printing are 1) June 1 to July 1; 2) August 1 to September 15; 3) Four (4) 
weeks before the beginning of each semester. In those situations requiring overtime, 
the University shall use the following procedure:  

A. The Employer will provide, whenever possible, forty-eight (48) hours notice of the 
overtime work.  

B. The employee with the least number of overtime hours in the affected classification 
and work group will be offered the overtime first. If that employee declines, the overtime 
offer will be made to the employee with the next lowest number of overtime hours. If the 
overtime is declined by all qualified employees in the classification and work group, the 
least senior qualified employee will work the overtime.  

C. The overtime work will not exceed five consecutive days for any employee.  

ARTICLE 46 - LONGEVITY PAY  

189 - All regular employees of the Employer shall be entitled to receive longevity pay for 
length of continuous service with the Employer according to the following rules and 
schedule of payment.  

190 - LONGEVITY YEAR The longevity year is defined as the twelve month period 
beginning October 1 of each year and ending September 30. For longevity payment 
purposes only, a year of continuous full-time service is defined as any longevity year in 
which the employee is actively employed for at least 39 calendar weeks (273 calendar 
days).  

191 - Longevity pay shall be computed as a percentage of the employee's regular 
annual base wage. Base wage shall be that wage which an employee is being paid on 
September 1 of the calendar year in which the longevity payment is due. The annual 
base wage shall be equal to the employee's hourly rate times 2080 hours as of 
September 1 of the calendar year. If an employee is not on the payroll at that time, the 
hourly rate to be used will be the hourly rate upon his/her return. Base wage shall not 
include overtime or premium pay.  

192 - INITIAL ELIGIBILITY The last date of hire as a regular employee will be used as 
the normal longevity date. To qualify for the first longevity payment, an employee must 
have completed six (6) years of continuous service as of October 1 of any year. To 
qualify for initial eligibility, the employee must have been on active employment for at 
least 39 calendar weeks (273 calendar days) for six (6) consecutive years and an 
employee as of October 1 of that year to receive the longevity payment. Periods of 
active employment of less than 39 calendar weeks will be counted toward the 
employee's years of continuous service.  

193 - CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY After establishing initial eligibility, employees must be 
actively employed for 39 calendar weeks (273 calendar days) during the longevity year 

and an employee as of October 1 to receive the longevity payment on December 1. 
Periods of active employment of less than 39 calendar weeks, while not qualifying the 
employee for payment of longevity, shall be counted toward the employee's years of 
continuous service.  

194 - Payments to employees who are eligible each October 1 will be paid on 
December 1. No longevity payment as shown in the schedule below shall be made for 
that portion of an employee's regular wage which is in excess of $9,500.  

195 - All regular employees as of July 22, 1996 shall be "grandfathered" under the 
current Longevity Pay program. Employees who hire into the bargaining unit after July 
22, 1996, will be, and shall remain, ineligible for the Longevity Pay program.

basic Blue Cross/Blue Shield coverage. The Employer contribution for three-quarter 
time employees will be seventy-five percent (75%) of the full-time contribution of the 
Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan and for one-half time employees will be fifty percent (50%) 
of the full-time contribution of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plan. In no event shall it 
exceed the full-time contribution for equivalent coverage. The monthly premium for 
dependents on sponsored dependent riders will be deducted from the employee's 
paycheck.  

200 - Effective June 30, 1996, employees enrolled in the Physician's Health Plan or

203 - Upon evidence of other health care coverage, employees eligible for MSU health 
care coverage are eligible to opt out of a MSU Health Care Plan each year during the 
May Health Care Plan Open Enrollment to become effective July 1 through June 30 of 
each year and receive a $600.00 lump-sum payment to be made in the month of July of

ARTICLE 51 - RETIREMENT BENEFITS  

A. University Retirement  

218 - University Retirement Defined - University retirement shall be defined as 1) 
attainment of age 62 or older with 15 years of employment, or 2) at any age with 25 
years of employment. Interruptions in employment of less than one (1) year's duration 
shall not constitute a break in service as it pertains to retirement.  

An employee returning after twelve (12) months of her/his termination from University 
employment shall, after five (5) additional years of employment, receive credit for all 
past seniority for the purpose of retirement only.  

With proper documentation, reemployed employees, after five (5) years of service, will 
be granted credit for all past seniority upon application to the Office of Human Resource 
Services.  

219 - Employees meeting the minimum retirement requirements will remain eligible to 
maintain group health and dental coverage and receive the Employer contribution. 
Effective 12/1/79, new retirees and covered spouses will remain eligible to maintain the

life insurance benefit.  

220 - An employee who retires under the definition in Paragraph 218 shall be paid for 
fifty (50) percent of his/her unused sick leave, but not to exceed a maximum of fifty (50) 
percent of one thousand two hundred (1200) hours, as of the effective date of 
separation.  

221 - An employee who does not meet the definition of University Retirement in 
Paragraph 218 but has at least five (5) years, but less than ten (10) years of continuous 
full-time service and has attained 65 years of age at the time of his/her separation shall

Paragraph 218 but has at least ten (10) years of continuous full-time service and has 
attained 65 years of age at the time of his/her separation shall be paid one hundred 
(100) percent of his/her unused sick leave as of the effective date of separation but not 
to exceed a maximum of one hundred (100) days unless he/she has received a 
University contribution to TIAA-CREF or other retirement programs made available 
through the University in which case he/she shall be paid as in Paragraph 220.  

222 - Prorated longevity payments shall be made to those employees who retire under 
the definition of University Retirement in Paragraph 218 prior to October first of any 
year. This also applies to those employees not under the definition of University 
Retirement in Paragraph 218 but who are 65 years of age at the time of their 
separation. Such prorated payments as indicated above shall be based on the number 
of calendar months of full-time service credited to an employee from the preceding 
October first to the date of retirement or separation and shall be made as soon as 
practicable thereafter.  

B. Base Retirement  

223 - Michigan State University provides a base retirement program with the Teachers 
Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) and its companion organization, College 
Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group or 

other retirement programs made available through the University and selected by the 
employee.  

224 - Eligibility and Participation - Regular full-time and part-time employees are eligible 
for participation in base retirement options through the University in accordance with the 
following policies:  

a. The program is optional to employees under age 35 or who are over age 62 at 
the time of employment.  

b. The program is required as a condition of employment for employees who 
have attained age 35.  

c. Once required participation commences, it is not possible to withdraw from the 
base retirement options while employed at the University. 

225 - Premium Contributions - The base retirement options made available through the 
University are financed by 5% reduction from employee base wage, overtime, and shift 
differential with the University contributing 10%.  

226 - It is further understood that the improved formula, contribution levels and method 
of benefit computation in addition to other provisions contained herein extend through 
the contract expiration date.  

227 - Complete details concerning the provisions of the University's base retirement 
options are outlined in a brochure which may be obtained from the Benefits Office.  

C. University Noncontributory Retirement Plan (UNCRP) (For employees hired prior to 
January 1, 1973)  

228 - The following provisions apply to those employees who meet the retirement 
definition described in Section A.  

229 - Effective January 1, 1973 the UNCRP ceased to exist. However, to ensure that no 
employee lost credit for prior years of service, the following guidelines were established 
to provide that an employee will receive no less than what an improved UNCRP formula 
would give him/her upon retirement.  

230 - Those persons employed prior to January 1, 1973, who were 55 years of age or 
older and/or had 25 years of service on January 1, 1973 could elect to remain subject to 
the improved UNCRP formula described below.  

231 - The formula governing the UNCRP was improved by basing pensions on an 
amount equal to the highest three (3) year average earnings, multiplied by 2% for each 
year of service, with a $3600 ceiling.  

232 - For employees participating in TIAA-CREF and/or other retirement programs 
made available through the University with a University contribution, the improved 
UNCRP formula will be calculated for each employee at retirement and will become the 
minimum received by the employee.  

233 - The annuity value at the time of retirement of MSU's contributions to TIAA-CREF 
and/or other retirement programs made available through the University will be 
compared to the pension amount as computed in Paragraph 231 above, and the 
employee will receive the larger of the two figures. Employee contributions to TIAA-
CREF and/or other retirement programs made available through the University 
(retroactive to 1-1-73) will provide additional annuity income.  

234 - Those employees not participating in TIAA-CREF or other retirement programs 
made available through the University will have their retirement figured solely on the 
improved UNCRP formula plus a 10% addition added to the base pension prior to 
actuarial reduction or the selection of a survivor option.  

235 - Employees who terminate without meeting the minimum requirements for 
retirement will receive an annuity income from the contributions made to the individual 
TIAA-CREF annuity contract or other retirement programs made available through the 
University consistent with provisions of other contracts.  

ARTICLE 52 - EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE  

A. Qualifications  

236 - The University provides assistance to enhance an employee's educational and 
career development needs and goals for regular full-time and part-time staff.  

237 - Tuition from an accredited educational institution will be reimbursed for up to 
fourteen (14) credits per MSU academic year upon successful completion of the 
course(s). A grade of 2.0 or better (or "CR" - credit) is required for a credit course.  

238 - Institutions under such government training programs as the G.I. Bill of Rights will 
also be accepted. Reimbursement for tuition at other institutions shall be no greater 
than the prevailing MSU resident lifelong education rates.  

239 - If the employee is covered by benefits such as scholarship or fellowship aid, 
government aid, GI benefits, or similar assistance, reimbursement will be made only for 
that portion of the tuition which exceeds the amount of those benefits.  

B. Release Time  

240 - When a course if not available during non-working hours, the employee may 
request release time with pay not to exceed five (5) hours per week to attend one 
course. The department administrator or designee shall determine whether unit 
functions will allow such release time to be granted. Such determination shall be within 
the sole discretion of the Employer.  

C. Eligibility  

241 - The benefits become effective if the first day of class commences after the 
employee has completed twelve (12) continuous full-time equivalent service months. 
The employee must have approval of his/her supervisor and/or department/unit 
administrator.  

242 - The employee must be admitted to the educational institution where the course 
work will be taken and must be employed full-time or part-time when course work is 
completed to be eligible for reimbursement. Employees who are laid off after a course(s) 
has begun will be eligible for reimbursement upon its completion.  

D. Tuition Reimbursement  

243 - To receive reimbursement for MSU courses, the employee shall submit the 
completed educational assistance form with departmental approval to Human Resource 
Development at least ten (10) days prior to the start of class. To receive reimbursement 
for non-MSU courses, the employee shall submit the completed educational assistance 
form with departmental approval to Human Resource Development at least ten (10) 
days prior to the start of class and send evidence that he/she has successfully 
completed the course within fifteen (15) days of the receipt or such evidence.  

244 - Reimbursement for the course(s) will be the MSU per credit tuition rate (not to 
exceed fourteen (14) per academic year), plus the MSU matriculation fees where 
applicable.  

E. Tuition Waiver  

245 - Bargaining unit members who are eligible for educational assistance shall be 
eligible for a tuition waiver program. This tuition waiver program will be applicable only 

to those MSU courses enrolled in through the University's standard registration 
procedure. As a condition of tuition waiver, an employee must sign an agreement 
authorizing payroll deduction for the amount of tuition waiver to be used in the event 
she/he does not successfully complete the course(s).  

246 - Employees interested in utilizing the tuition waiver program must submit their 
educational assistance application complete with departmental approval to Human 
Resource Development thirty (30) days prior to the semester billing date set by the Fees 
and Scholarship office. The application must be marked with a request for tuition waiver.  

247 - If the above timelines are met and the educational assistance application is 
approved, Human Resource Development will forward a list of employees eligible for 
tuition waiver to the Fees and Scholarship office and to the Union.  

248 - Employees will be responsible for all charges in excess of the matriculation fee 
and in excess of fourteen (14) credit hours over the academic year. Human Resource 
Development will supply the Fees and Scholarships office with the total credits available 
for tuition waiver for each eligible employee. In the event the approved course(s) is/are 
unavailable at the time of registration, other appropriate course(s) may be substituted 
and the application amended subject to the approval of the department administrator or 
designee and Human Resource Development.  

249 - Employees who have had their tuition waived authorize Human Resource 
Development to verify successful completion of approved courses at the end of the 
semester. In cases where tuition waivers are withdrawn (e.g. terminated employee, non-
approved course, unsuccessful completion), the University will attempt to payroll deduct 
the waiver tuition. If the University is unable to make collection through payroll 
deduction, the Union agrees to be responsible for the outstanding debt(s).  

F. Non-credit Courses  

250 - Employees may apply for reimbursement and release time for job-related, non-
credit courses which are offered through the University Outreach (e.g., Lifelong 
Education, Continuing Education and Evening College), MSU computing and 
technology training programs, Davenport College, Lansing Community College, and 
high school adult education programs, Human Resource Development programs or 
other Human Resource Development approved educational/training programs.  

251 - If non-credit courses only are being taken during an academic year, 
reimbursement will not exceed eight hundred ($800.00) dollars.  

252 - If non-credit courses are being taken during the same academic year as a course 
per paragraph 244 above, the total reimbursement will not exceed the MSU rate per 
credit for fourteen (14) credit hours.  

253 - Employees must document their successful completion of non-credit courses by 
submitting either (1) a certificate from the course signed by the instructor, or (2) a form 
provided by Human Resource Development signed by the instructor.

LETTERS OF AGREEMENT 

 

April 11, 1983  
   

Mr. Ronald Mateer  
President, Local 999  
Campus  

Dear Mr. Mateer:  

Recognizing the concern expressed by the membership of Local 999 AFSCME over the issue of 
the classification, Maintenance Mechanic, the University proposes that:  

1. The following classifications will be used in the operations of the Mechanical Shop as it is 
presently structured:  

Plumber Mechanic  
Refrigeration Mechanic  
Metal Worker Mechanic  
Maintenance Mechanic  
HVAC Mechanic  

2. Those employees presently classified as Maintenance Mechanics shall, within thirty (30) 
calendar days from the effective date of this Agreement, have the option to be reclassified into 
another applicable classification or to remain as Maintenance Mechanics.  

3. No employee will be classified or reclassified as a Maintenance Mechanic without his written 
approval.  

4. If the Employer finds it necessary to relocate or transfer any portion of the mechanical systems 
operations into another area of the Physical Plant, the Employer may do so without violating the 
intent of this letter nor will the Employer be required to change the employee's existing 
classification when such a transfer is made.  

The above is amended to the extent it has been modified by the Classification study 
recommendations which become effective on and after March 3, 1980.  

Very truly yours,  

Samuel A. Baker Director, Employee Relations  

Acceptance of Union

MEMORANDUM  
   

DATE:  November 23, 1999  

TO: Dennis Lantzy, President  
AFSCME Local 999  

FROM: Samuel A. Baker, Director  
Office of Employee Relations  

SUBJECT: Same-Sex Domestic Partner Benefit Eligibility  

The Employer will add benefit eligibility to same-sex domestic partners of regular 
applicable staff who meet the following criteria.  

They:  

 

1.  are same-sex and for this reason are unable to marry each other under 

Michigan Law, 

2.  are in long-term committed relationship, have been in the relationship for 

at least 6 months, and intend to remain together indefinitely, 

3.  are not married to others and neither has another domestic partner, 
4.  are at least 18 years of age and have the capacity to enter into a 

contract, 

5.  are not related to one another closely enough to bar marriage in 

Michigan, 

6.  share a residence and have done so for more than 6 months, 
7.  are jointly responsible to each other for the necessities of life, 
8.  provide a signed "partnership agreement" that obligates each of the 

parties to provide support for one another, and provides for substantially 
equal division, upon termination of the relationship, of earnings during the 
relationship and any property acquired with those earnings. 

Same-sex domestic partners’ children will be eligible for health and dental benefits if 
they:  

1.  are qualified and claimed as an IRS-defined dependent by the domestic 

partner, and 

2.  are members of the employee’s household or a full-time student, and 
3.  are unmarried and under the age of 19 (if a full-time student, up to the 
end of the year they reach age 25 for health benefits, and up to the end 
of the year they reach age 23 for dental benefits). 

Employees enrolling same-sex domestic partners will be required to complete a 
Domestic Partnership Declaration and provide a signed "partnership agreement." They 
will have to keep a "partnership agreement" meeting the criteria described above in 
effect to be eligible for domestic partner benefits.  

The following benefits will be provided to same-sex domestic partners and their 
dependents as for a regular employee’s spouse and other dependents:  

1.  family and medical leave 
2.  COBRA continuation 
3.  course fee courtesy 
4.  ID cards 
5.  access to library, recreational, and athletic facilities 
6.  university apartments 
7.  parental, sick and bereavement leaves 
8.  child care services 
9.  health insurance* 
10. dental insurance* 
11. post-retirement benefits* 
12. employee-paid life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance* 

(* These benefits will be provided on the same basis as for other 
employees if they can be renegotiated with carriers to obtain equivalent 
coverage without a premium surcharge) 

The University will provide a premium contribution for same-sex domestic partner 
benefits comparable to that provided for a regular employee’s spouse and dependents 
(subject to taxation as required by federal, state, and other applicable law).
