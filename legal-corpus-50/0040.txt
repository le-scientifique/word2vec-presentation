receipt of the grievance to have a meeting with the grieved party and/or with a Union 
representative and to communicate a decision in writing to the Union. If the grievance is 

not settled to the satisfaction of the employee and the Union,  or if no reply is 
communicated after the five (5) working days, the grievance may proceed to Step III.

disagreement over the interpretation or application of a specific provision of the 
agreement, to be settled by arbitration. The Union shall inform the Board in writing of the 
decision to arbitrate.

Arbitration Association for the selection of the arbitrator in accordance with the rules 
then obtaining, of said Association applicable to labor arbitration. Any arbitration 
hereunder shall be conducted in accordance with such rules, subject to the provisions of

writing but all the steps of this procedure shall be handled as expeditiously as possible 
with a view to promoting and maintaining harmony. Request of either party for 
extensions of time shall not be unreasonably denied.  
 

Failure at any step of this procedure by the Library Director, his/her designee or 
the Board to communicate a decision in writing on a grievance within the time specified 
shall permit an appeal of the grievance to the next step. Failure at any step of this 
procedure to appeal a grievance to the next step within the specified time limits shall be

June 39, 1996.  

b.  As of June 30, 1996, no sick days shall accrue to employees having a 
sick leave balance of 60 or more days and the maximum accrual shall 
become 60 days for employees having a sick leave balance of 60 or 
fewer days on that date.  

c.  As of June 30, 1996k employees having a sick leave balance in excess 

of 60 days may make one of the following elections:

days to one (1) recognition day (rounded to the next highest whole

                      54 sick days  
 
                      3 (the conversion ratio is 3:1)  
 
                      18 recognition days result, new sick leave balance is 45.  
 

Sick leave is used for illness or accident of employee, employee's domestic 

partner or children.  
 

Employees terminating employment because of illness will remain on full salary 

for the period of accrued sick leave. However said employees may opt to take a lump 
sum payment of one-half (1/2) their accrued sick leave calculated at the rate of pay in 
effect on their last day of employment.  
 

Upon retirement an employee shall receive payment for the balance of sick leave 
accrued in his/her account in a lump sum calculated at the rate of pay in effect on the day 
of retirement.

changing jobs, up to the amount of the maximum accrual set forth above.
