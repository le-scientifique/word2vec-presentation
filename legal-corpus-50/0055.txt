ARTICLE I – REPRESENTATION 

This Collective Bargaining Agreement (hereinafter Agreement) is entered into by the City and County of San 
Francisco  (hereinafter  City)  acting  through  its  designated  representatives  and  the  Service  Employees 
International Union, Locals 250, 790 and 535 (hereinafter Union). 
 

ARTICLE I – REPRESENTATION 

RECOGNITION 
Classifications Currently Represented 
The City acknowledges that the Union has been certified by the Municipal Employee Relations Panel 
or  the  Civil  Service  Commission  as  the  recognized  employee  representative,  pursuant  to  the 
provisions as set forth in the City's Employee Relations Ordinance, for the classifications listed in 
Attachment A and employees in these classifications who perform duties for the City and County of 
San Francisco, San Francisco Unified School District and the Community College District. The 
provisions  of  this  Agreement  shall  apply  to  said  employees  to  the  extent  authorized  by  law  as 
provided in Charter Section A8.409-1. 

Placement of New Classifications 
Any non-supervisory, new or amended classification or reclassification not claimed by another Union 
and  related  to  SEIU  represented  classes  shall  be  automatically    assigned  to  a  bargaining  unit 
represented by SEIU. The current practice as established by the Employee Relations Ordinance will 
continue for supervisory classes. The Union will be notified within seven (7) calendar days of any 
such assignments. 

Whenever a new class is created by the Department of Human Resources which is the result of 
consolidation or splitting off of one or more former classes, and in those instances when the duties 
and responsibilities of the new class(es) are the same or similar to those of the former class(es), then 
the bargaining unit assignment and representation shall continue to be the same as for the former 
class(es) without notice and appeal procedures required by the CSC Rule and provisions of the San 
Francisco Administrative Code. 

 

Should there be a dispute regarding appropriate Unit assignment of any such classification(s), such 
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the grievance and arbitration procedure. 

Applicability of the Agreement to All Newly Recognized Classifications 
The  terms  and  provisions  of  this  Agreement  shall  also  be  automatically  applicable  to  any 
classifications for which the Union has become appropriately recognized during the term of this 
agreement.  Such  classifications  shall  also  receive  the  appropriate  differentials  and  premiums 
applicable to related classifications.   

Issues related to classification descriptions shall be subject to the meet and confer process with final 
review by the Civil Service Commission.  Issues related to the effects of classification decisions on 
hours,  wages,  terms  and  conditions  of  employment  shall  be  subject  to  negotiations  and  interest 
arbitration.

INTENT 
It is the intent of the parties signatory hereto that the provisions of this Agreement shall become 
binding upon adoption or acceptance by the City and ratification by the general  memberships of the 
Unions of the Joint Council or upon a final decision rendered by an arbitration panel pursuant to the 
interest arbitration procedure under Charter Section A8.409. 

Upon  adoption,  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  shall  supersede  and  control  over  contrary  or 
contradictory Charter provisions, ordinances, resolutions, rules or regulations of the City to the extent 
permissible by Charter Section A8.409. 

In the event the parties reach a tentative agreement, the Employee Relations Director and the Union 
negotiating team shall present a full tentative agreement, signed by the Employee Relations Director 
and representatives of the Union negotiating team, to the City and the Union general memberships for 
ratification  within  sixty  (60)  days  of  signing  such  full  tentative  agreement  together  with  their 
recommendations. 

Pursuant to the provisions of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, as amended, the City agrees to meet and 
confer with the Union in advance regarding any proposed changes in working conditions within the 
scope of representation. 

 
C.  MANAGEMENT RIGHTS 
11. 

Except  to  the  extent  there  is  contained  in  this  Agreement  express  and  specific  provision  to  the 
contrary, nothing herein shall be construed to restrict any legal city rights concerning direction of its 
work  force,  or  consideration  of  the  merits,  necessity  or  organization  of  any  service  or  activity 
provided by the City.  The City shall also have the right to determine the mission of its constituent 
departments, officers, boards and commissions; set standards of services to be offered to the public; 
and exercise control and discretion over the city's organization and operations.  The City may also 
relieve employees from duty due to lack of work or funds, and may determine the methods, means 
and personnel by which the City's operations are to be conducted. 

However, the exercise of such rights does not preclude represented employees or the union from 
utilizing the grievance procedure to process grievances regarding the practical consequences of any 
such actions on wages, hours, benefits or other terms and conditions of employment. 

NO WORK STOPPAGE 
It is mutually agreed and understood that during the period this Agreement is in force and effect the 
Union  will  not  authorize  or  engage  in  any  strike,  slowdown,  or  work  stoppage.  Represented 
employees are also bound by the above.  The City agrees not to conduct a lockout against any of the 
employees covered by this agreement during the term of this Agreement. 

OBJECTIVE OF THE CITY 
It is agreed that the delivery of municipal services in the most efficient, effective and courteous 
manner is of paramount importance to the City and its employees.  Such achievement is recognized to 
be  a  mutual  obligation  of  the  parties  to  this  Agreement  within  their  respective  roles  and 
responsibilities.

UNION SECURITY 
Application 
Except as provided otherwise herein, the provisions of this Section shall apply to all employees of the 
City in all classifications represented by SEIU Locals 250, 790 and 535, either jointly or individually, 
in representation units 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9, when on paid status, except those mutually designated 
classifications and mutually designated individual on-call employees who are employed for less than 
20 hours per week. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to individual employees of the City 
in representation units 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9 who have been properly and finally determined to be 
management, confidential or supervisory employees pursuant to Section 16.208 of the Employer-
Employee Relations Ordinance. 

 
16.  When the Employee Relations Director receives a request from a department head to designate 
position(s) as management, supervisory or confidential, the Employee Relations Director shall give 
the Union notice of such request.  The Union shall have ten  (10) working  days within which to 
request a meeting to discuss the requested designation(s).  Upon request of the Union, the Employee 
Relations Director and the Union shall meet to discuss the requested designation(s).  In accordance 
with Section 16.208 of the Employee Relations Ordinance, the Employee Relations Director shall 
thereafter approve or disapprove the requested designation(s). 

If the Union disagrees with such designation(s), the Union may submit the matter to an Administrative 
Law Judge for hearing and final determination as provided in the Employee Relations Ordinance.  The 
Union and the City may jointly request that the assigned Administrative Law Judge have a labor 
relations background. 

Designation(s) of position(s) by the Employee Relations Director as management, supervisory or 
confidential for which no challenge has been filed by the Union shall result in termination of agency 
shop fees if applicable.  Challenges of designation(s) by the Union shall result in agency shop fees 
being placed in escrow until the disagreement is resolved by an Administrative Law Judge.  Following 
final  determination  by  the  Administrative  Law  Judge,  the  fees  shall  be  dispersed  to  either  the 
employee or the Union depending on who prevails. 

Agency Shop 
For the term of this Agreement, all current and future employees of the City as described paragraph 
15 above except as set forth below, shall, as a condition of continued employment, become and 
remain a member of the Union or, in lieu thereof, shall pay a service fee to the Union.  Such service 
fee  payment  shall  not  exceed  the  standard  initiation  fee,  periodic  dues  and  general  assessments 
(hereinafter  collectively  termed  membership  fees)  of  the  Union  representing  the  employee's 
classification.  The service fee payment shall be established annually by the  Union, provided that such 
agency shop service fee will be used by the union only for the purposes of collective bargaining, 
contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other terms and conditions of 
employment. 

Religious Exemption 
Any employee of the City in a classification described in Section A hereof, paragraph 15 above who is 
a member of a bona fide religion, body or sect which has historically held conscientious objections to 
joining or financially supporting a public employee organization and is recognized by the National

Labor Relations Board to hold such objections to Union membership, shall, upon presentation of 
membership  and  historical  objection  satisfactory  to  the  City  and  the  Union,  be  relieved  of  any 
obligation to pay the required service fee. 

Payroll Deductions 
The Union shall provide the Employee Relations Director and the City Controller with a complete list 
of the City classifications subject to this Section represented by each constituent union of the SEIU 
Joint Council and a current statement of membership fees.  Such list of represented classifications and 
statement of membership fees shall be amended as necessary.  The Controller may take up to 30 days 
to implement such changes.  The Controller shall make required membership fee or service fee payroll 
deductions solely for the Union representing the employee's classification as designated on the list 
submitted by the Union.  An employee may, on a voluntary basis, request a payroll deduction for 
Union membership in another SEIU Local Union, in addition to the service fee deduction. 

Each pay period, the Controller shall make membership fee or service fee deductions, as appropriate, 
from the regular periodic payroll warrant of each City employee described paragraph 15 above. 

Service fees from nonmembers shall be collected by payroll deduction pursuant to Administrative 
Code Section 16.90.  Failure to comply with this Section shall be grounds for termination.  The 
Union, at its option, may elect to waive its right to demand termination and instead utilize judicial 
process to compel payment. 

Effective  with  the  first  complete  pay  period  worked  by  an  employee  newly  employed  in  a 
classification described paragraph 15 above and each pay period thereafter, the Controller shall make 
membership fee or service fee and initiation deductions, as appropriate, from the regular payroll 
warrant of each such employee. 

Nine (9) working days following payday the Controller will promptly pay over to the appropriate 
Union all sums withheld  for membership or service fees. The Controller shall also provide with each 
payment a list of employees paying service fees.  All such lists shall contain the employee's name, 
employee  number,  classification,  department  number  and  the  amount  deducted.    A  list  of  all 
employees in represented classes shall be provided to the Union monthly. 

Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to have altered the City's current obligation to make insurance 
program or political action deductions when requested by the employee. 

The union shall be entitled to collect, through the payroll deduction method, membership dues, COPE 
deductions, and any special membership assessments, and through that system, may make changes as 
may be required, from time-to-time.  The Union shall give the Controller appropriate written notice of 
any changes in existing deductions, or the establishment of new bases for deduction. 

Employees Exempt from Agency Shop 
Employees covered by this Agreement not subject to the agency shop requirement set forth above and 
who have voluntarily joined the Union shall, for the administrative convenience of the parties, be 
permitted to revoke an authorization for the deduction of union dues during the month of January of 
any year only.  Any request for such revocation shall be delivered in person to the Office of the

Controller or may be sent by U.S. Mail to the Controller, 875 Stevenson Street, San Francisco  
94103.  The City shall deliver a copy of any revocation notice to the Union not later than March 1. 

Financial Reporting 
Annually, the Union will provide an explanation of the fee and sufficient financial information to 
enable  the  service  fee  payer  to  gauge  the  appropriateness  of  the  fee.  The  Union  will  provide  a 
reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision maker 
not chosen by the Union and will make provision for an escrow account to hold amounts reasonably 
in dispute while challenges are pending. 

Indemnification 
The Union agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City for any loss or damage arising from the 
operation of this Agreement. 

OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES AND STEWARDS 
Official Representatives 
The Union may select as many as one employee member of such organization from the appropriate 
unit represented by such organization, and one additional such employee member for each two-
hundred and fifty (250) employees in such unit; or fraction thereof, in excess of two-hundred (200) 
employees in such unit, to attend, during regular duty or work hours without loss of compensation, 
meetings scheduled with the Civil Service Commission, the Department of Human Resources, the 
Director  of  Employee  Relations,  or  designee,  when  such  meetings  have  been  scheduled  for  the 
purpose  of  city-wide  Agreement  meeting  and  conferring  on  all  matters  within  the  scope  of 
representation affecting such appropriate unit, and to participate in the discussions, deliberations, and 
decisions at such meetings. The selection of such employee members, or substitutions or replacements 
therefore, and their attendance at meetings during their regular duty or work hours, shall be subject to 
the following: 

  

  

  

  

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

The  organization's  duly  authorized  representative  shall  inform  in  writing  the 
department head or officer under whom each selected employee member is employed 
that such employee has been selected. 

No  selected  member  shall  leave  the  duty  or  work  station,  or  assignment  without 
specific approval of the employee's department head or other authorized management 
official. 

In scheduling meetings, reasonable consideration shall be given to the operating needs 
and work schedules of the department, division, or section in which the employee 
members are employed. 

Official representatives who are assigned to evening and night shift work schedules 
and who participate in meeting and conferring during day shift hours shall be released 
from  their  regular  shift  pursuant  to  the  rules  established  herein.  Official

ARTICLE I – REPRESENTATION 

Release time for official representatives engaged in meeting and conferring affecting a department or 
other work unit of City government shall be determined by mutual agreement. 

The rules for release time for City-wide meeting and conferring shall apply. 

Stewards 
The Union shall furnish the City with an accurate list of City-wide shop stewards and designated 
officers from each Local in areas as designated by the Union. The Union may submit an amendment 
to  the  list  at  any  time.  An  employee  has  no  status  as  a  steward  unless  the  City  has  received 
verification in writing from the Union that the employee is a steward in a given area. 

The Union recognizes that it is the responsibility of the shop steward to assist in the resolution of 
grievances at the lowest possible level. 

Upon notification of an appropriate management person, stewards and designated officers of the 
Union, subject to management approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, shall be granted 
reasonable release time to investigate and process grievances, disciplinary appeals and attend meetings 
with  Management  without  loss  of  pay  or  benefits.    Union  Stewards  shall  advise their first level 
supervisors prior to engaging in Union business.  Such notification of release time shall normally be 
made in advance and shall include the area or work location where they will be investigating or 
processing grievances, disciplinary appeals or meetings with Management.  The Union will attempt to 
insure that shop steward release time will be equitably distributed.  Normally one steward will be 
sufficient  for  a  single  investigation  of  a  grievance  or  appeal,  except  for  Shop  Steward  Trainee 
Observers. 

In emergency situations, where immediate disciplinary action must be taken because of a violation of 
law or a City departmental rule (intoxication, theft, etc.) a shop steward shall not unreasonably be 
denied the right to leave his/her post or duty to represent the employee. 

Except  in  emergency  situations,  an  investigative,  disciplinary  or  grievance  meeting  shall  be 
rescheduled if a Shop Steward is denied release time. 

Shop stewards shall not interfere with the work of any employee. A shop steward may interview an 
employee during the employee's regular work time in order to investigate or process a grievance or 
disciplinary appeal with the approval of the employee's supervisor, which shall not unreasonably be 
withheld. 

Stewards shall be responsible for the performance of their work load, consistent with release time 
approved pursuant to rules established herein. 

Stewards shall receive timely notice of and shall be permitted to make appearances at departmental 
orientation  sessions  in  order  to  distribute  union  materials  and  to  discuss  employee  rights  and 
obligations under this Agreement.  

Any meeting of shop steward and supervisor shall be held in private surroundings and shall be held in 
a quiet and dignified manner.

work areas.  The Union shall be responsible for their installation and operation and all costs relating

machines  shall  be  deposited  in  a  special  fund  under  the  direction  and  control  of  the  Union  and 
allocated exclusively for the benefit of employees' recreation and welfare.

City.

period extended by the period of  such leave in order to complete the required period of service.  
Disability leave shall extend the probationary period in all cases. 

CONTRACTING OUT OF WORK 
Due to the size of the bargaining unit and the diversity of the classifications and employees within the 
unit, which enable the employees to perform various services in the diverse communities served by the 
City, the Mayor and the Union agree that, for the term of this 1997-2000 Agreement, the Mayor shall 
instruct the City's Department Heads over whom he has budgetary authority that: 

 

 

Department heads shall not initiate and the Mayor shall not approve requests to contract out 
any routine work currently performed by existing employees represented by the Union; and 

Department heads shall not lay off current bargaining unit members or eliminate existing 
bargaining unit positions as a result of contracting out. 

This  instruction  shall  not  in  any  way  affect  (i)  existing  contracts  (which  shall  include  proposed 
contracts funded with monies appropriated in the 1996-97 budget), (ii) renewals, amendments or 
extensions of those contracts, or (iii) new contracts either for services already contracted out or 
arising from the City's receipt of new and/or additional federal, state, or grant funds designated for 
new or unique programs.  However, such funds shall not include growth in general fund or enterprise 
revenues in force and effect at the time of the signing of this Agreement.  

The Mayor agrees that it is not the intent of the City to use the contracting out process to avoid 
prevailing wages, compliance with MBE/WBE requirements, or payment of health or other benefits. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Mayor may propose pursuant to the City's 
standard procedures to contract out work currently performed by existing City employees (a) where 
external  funding  sources  require  the  use  of  outside  third  parties  to  perform  services;  or  (b) in 
emergency  situations,  as  determined  by  the  Mayor  and  upon  a  majority  vote  of  the  Board  of 
Supervisors.   

Should the Mayor determine that the restrictions contained in this section unduly interfere with a 
department's or the City's ability to provide appropriate services to the diverse communities within the 
City, the Mayor and the Union agree to meet in order to resolve the concerns.  If the Mayor and the 
Union cannot mutually agree, the matter shall be submitted to an arbitrator, selected pursuant to the 
provisions of Article IV (Grievance Procedure) of this Agreement, who shall decide the issue of 
whether a proposal to contract out work may be initiated by the Mayor.

shall be adjusted to two (2) steps to the closest step representing a 10% increase in 
the  salary  grade  over  the  salary  received  in  the  lower  class  but  not  above  the 
maximum of the salary range of the appropriate classification. 

If the employee is receiving a salary in his/her present classification which is less then 
the entrance step of the salary range of the promotive classification, the employee 
shall receive a salary step in the promotive class which is closest to an adjustment of

shall be determined in the biweekly salary grade and shall not be above the maximum 
of the salary range of the promotive class. 

2. 

Provisional to Promotive 

 

356.  Consistent with the Temporary Employees' Agreement attached hereto, a provisional appointee who 
accepts appointment to a promotive position from a regular eligible list shall have his/her salary in the 
promotive appointment based on the salary in his/her regular civil service next lowest rank position 
from which s/he gained promotive eligibility, except as herein provided. 

If the following conditions are met, the salary in the promotive appointment shall be not less than the 
salary received under provisional appointment: 

That the employee was serving under permanent provisional appointment for at least 
six (6) months  immediately prior to accepting such regular promotive appointment. 

That the employee received a salary above the entrance rate of the compensation 
schedule in the permanent limited tenure appointment. 

That if the salary steps in the provisional class and the regular promotional class do 
not match, the employee shall be advanced to the salary step in the compensation 
schedule nearest that received in the provisional appointment. 

Further increments in the compensation schedule in the regular promotive class shall 
be  based  on  the  date  of  permanent  appointment  to  the  regular  promotional 
appointment. 
 

Nonpromotive Appointment 

362.  When an employee accepts an appointment in a class having the same or lower salary grade, the 
employee shall be placed at the step nearest to, but not less than their current salary, not to exceed the

exists,  such  that  all  city  appointments  in  the  particular  class should be above the

The appointee possesses special experience, qualifications and/or skills which, in the 
Appointing Officer's opinion, warrants appointment above the entrance rate.

2. 
When  a  classification  that  was  formerly  a  next  lower  rank  in  a  regular  civil  service

classification, unless such salary is less than the employee would have been entitled to if 
promoted directly to the intermediate classification.  Further increments shall be based upon 
the increment anniversary date that would have applied in the higher classification. 

Reemployment In a Formerly Held Classification 

3.

Union a monthly report on computer diskette.  Two data sets shall be included on the diskette. The 
first will include employee name, class name and number and employment status, time in position, and 
total number of employees represented by the Union by department and classification.  The second 
will list all represented classes containing any provisional employees.  It will indicate the list adoption 
date if a list exists and one or two additional dates related to the list adoption process.  The parties 
may mutually agree to add data fields that may be requested by the Unions that do not infringe upon

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 
Definition 

464.  A Grievance shall be defined as any dispute which involves the interpretation or application of, or 

compliance with this Agreement, discipline or discharge. 

465.  The  Union  and  the  City  agree  that  the  following  guidelines  will  be  used  in  the  submission  of 

Grievance Description 

grievances: 

 
466. 
 
467. 
 
468. 
 

 
470. 

 

 

The basis and date of the grievance as known at the time of submission; 

The section(s) of the contract which the Union believes has been violated; 

The remedy or solution being sought by the Grievant. 

 

 

 

a. 

b. 

c. 

Procedure 

469.  Only the Union shall have the right on behalf of a disciplined or discharged employee to grieve the 

discipline or discharge action. 

In no event shall a grievance include a claim for money relief for more than a thirty (30) working day 
period prior to the initiation of the grievance. In the event that the parties agree to settle a grievance 
through  a  formal  settlement  agreement  containing  a  back  pay  provision  or  in  the  event  that  an 
arbitrator makes an award pursuant to this MOU’s grievance procedure that includes back pay, the 
City  will  issue  a  check  in  the  appropriate  amount  within  90  days  from  the  date  the  settlement 
agreement is fully executed or, in the case of an arbitration award, within 90 days from either: (a) the 
date of receipt of an arbitration award that sets forth a specific dollar amount of back pay; or (b) the 
date the parties verify and agree on the specific back pay calculation.  If the City does not meet this 
90-day deadline, the grievant(s) shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 5% per year beginning on the 
91st day until the date the check is issued.  In the event that either party moves to judicially challenge 
the arbitration award, the ninety (90) day deadline shall apply upon the resolution of such challenge, 
assuming the resolution to the judicial challenge is final and contains a specific dollar amount as 
discussed above. 

 
471.  The  management  representative  named  in  the  Steps  of  this  grievance  procedure  may  appoint  a 
designated  representative  to  act  on  his/her  behalf  with  the  accompanying authority to settle the 
grievance at the appropriate grievance step. 

Time Limits 

472.  The parties have agreed upon this grievance procedure in order to ensure the swift resolution of all 
grievances.  It is critical to the process that each step is  followed within the applicable timelines.  
Steps  are  skipped  only  with  the  express,  prior  approval  of  the  other  party,  except  as  outlined 
paragraphs 477-480. 

 
473.  All time limits referred to in this section are binding on each party.

ARTICLE IV – GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE & PERSONNEL FILES 

 
474.  A time limit may be extended by the Union and the Management Official responsible for the decision 
making at the particular step of the process by agreement entered into prior to the expiration of the 
time limit.  This agreement must be confirmed in writing by the party initiating the extension request.  
Failure by the Union to follow the time limits, unless mutually extended, shall cause the grievance to 
be withdrawn.  Failure of the City to follow the time limits shall serve to move the grievance to the 
next step. 

 
475.  Any deadline date under this procedure that falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Holiday shall be continued 

to the next business day. 

Employee Grievance Procedure 

476.  An employee having a grievance may first discuss it with the employee's immediate supervisor, or the 
next level in management, to try to work out a satisfactory solution in an informal manner. The 
employee may have a representative at this discussion.

Step I  Immediate Supervisor 
If a solution to the grievance, satisfactory to the employee and the immediate supervisor is not 
accomplished by informal discussion, the Union may pursue the grievance further. 

The Union shall submit a written statement of the grievance to the immediate supervisor 
within fifteen (15) calendar days of the facts or event giving rise to the grievance, or within 
fifteen (15) calendar days from such time as the employee or Union should have known of the 
occurrence thereof.  In cases alleging sexual harassment, the time limit during which to file a 
grievance shall be four (4) months. 

The  immediate  supervisor  will  make  every  effort  to  arrive  at  a  prompt  resolution  by 
investigating the issue.  He/she shall respond in writing within five (5) calendar days. 

Grievances related to a suspension or termination of an employee may be submitted initially at 
Step  II  of  this  procedure  within  fifteen  (15)  calendar  days  of  the  date  of  final  notice  of 
disciplinary action. 

Step II  Department Head/Designee 
If  the  grievance  is  not  satisfactorily  resolved  in  Step  I,  the  written  grievance  shall  be 
advanced,  containing  a  specific  description  of  the  basis  for  the  claim  and  the  resolution 
desired, and submitted to the department head or his/her designee within fifteen (15) calendar 
days of receipt of the Step I response.  The parties shall meet within fifteen (15) calendar 
days, unless a mutually agreed upon alternative is established.  The department head/designee 
shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the written grievance, or within ten (10) 
calendar days of the date the meeting is held, whichever comes later, respond in writing to the 
grievant  and  the  Union,  specifying  his/her  reason(s)  for  concurring  with  or  denying  the 
grievance.

Step III  Director, Employee Relations/Designee 
If  the  decision  of  the  department  head/designee  is  unsatisfactory, the Union may, within 
fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Department's decision, submit the grievance in 
writing to the Employee Relations Director. 

The Director or designee shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the written 
grievance in which to review and seek resolution of the grievance and respond in writing. 

Subject to applicable law, the Director of Employee Relations shall have authority to settle 
grievances at this step. 

Step IV  Final and Binding Arbitration 
Should there be no satisfactory resolution at Step III, the Union has the right to submit and 
advance the grievance to final and binding arbitration within thirty (30) calendar days of 
receipt of the Step III response.  On an annual basis, the City and the Union shall establish a 
Standing Arbitration Panel by each submitting a list of seven (7) arbitrators.  In any grievance 
referred to arbitration, the parties shall alternately strike from said List until a single name 
remains, and said arbitrator shall be designated to hear the matter.  Whether the Union or City 
deletes the first name in the alternating process shall be determined by lot. 

Except when a statement of facts mutually agreeable to the Union and City is submitted to the 
arbitrator, it shall be the duty of the arbitrator to hear and consider facts submitted by the 
parties. 

The City and the Union must commence selecting the arbitrator and scheduling the arbitration 
within thirty (30) calendar days of ERD's receipt of the Union's arbitration request.  The 
parties agree to recommend to the selected arbitrator that the hearing be scheduled within 
ninety (90) calendar days of his/her selection.  Should the designated arbitrator be unable to 
comply with this requirement, the parties shall by mutual agreement commence contacting 
other arbitrators on the panel, beginning with the last struck, until an arbitrator is selected 
who will meet such requirement. 

The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this 
Agreement. 

The  parties  shall  encourage  the  arbitrator  to  make  his/her  awards  within  forty-five  (45) 
calendar  days  following  the  receipt  of  closing  arguments  or  briefs.    The  decision  of  the 
arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties. 

Each party shall bear its own expenses in connection therewith.  All fees and expenses of the 
arbitrator and court reporter and report, if any, shall be borne and paid in full and shared 
equally by the parties.  Transcript costs shall be paid separately by the party requesting the 
transcript.  If parties mutually request, and the arbitrator agrees, a court reporter may not be 
required.

City, they shall be compensated at an appropriate rate of pay for time spent. 

Expedited Arbitration 

492.  Suspensions up to and including fifteen (15) days and written warnings shall be processed through an 
expedited arbitration proceeding.  By mutual written agreement entered into, before or during Step 
III of the grievance procedure, the parties may submit other grievances to this expedited arbitration 
process.  At least one day each month will be used for these grievances.  The expedited arbitration 
shall be before an arbitrator to be mutually selected by the parties who shall serve until the parties 
mutually agree to remove him/her or for twelve (12) months, whichever comes first.  Alternatively, at 
the time of the selection of the arbitrator, either party may request a list of seven (7) appropriately 
experienced arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association from which the arbitrator will be 
selected by the method of striking names.  The parties shall not use briefs.  Every effort shall be made 
to have bench decisions followed up by written decisions.  These decisions will be final and binding, 
and shall not be used in any other cases except those of the grievant involved.  Transcription by a 
certified court reporter shall be taken but shall be transcribed only at the direction of the arbitrator. 
 

493.  Each  party  shall  bear  its  own  expenses  in  connection  therewith.    All  fees  and  expenses  of  the 
arbitrator and court reporter and report, if any, shall be borne and paid in full and shared equally by 
the parties. 

In the event that an expedited arbitration hearing is canceled resulting in a cancellation fee, the party 
initiating the request or causing the cancellation shall bear the full cost of the cancellation fee, unless a 
mutually agreed upon alternative is established. 

Rights of Individuals 

495.  An employee may not be disciplined or discharged without just cause and without written notice of 

the intended action.  The City agrees to follow the principles of progressive discipline. 

 
496.  Employees who are released or disciplined during their initial probationary period or during any 
probationary period established by this Agreement, may appeal the release or discipline provided that 
the grounds for the grievance or appeal shall be limited to a claimed violation of the provisions of 
Article II.A. (Discrimination Prohibited or Reasonable Accommodation).  In such an appeal the 
employee shall bear the burden of proof with respect to the claimed violation. 

 
497.  Employees  covered  by  this  agreement  with  temporary  status  shall  be  subject  to  termination  or

provision is the date of the charging letter or notice.  The discipline imposed may take into account 
conduct  which  is  documented  in  the  employee's  personnel  file  or  was  the  subject  of  a  prior 
disciplinary action. 

 
506.  Materials relating to disciplinary actions in the employee's personnel file which have been in the file 
three (3) years or more shall not be used.  At the request of the employee, materials relating to 
disciplinary actions which are three (3) or more years old shall be removed, provided there has been

A. 

HEALTH AND SAFETY 
Policy 

551.  The  City  acknowledges  its  responsibility  to  provide  safe,  healthful  work  environments  for  City 
employees and users of City services. Every employee has the right to safe and healthful working 
conditions. 

 
552.  Upon request of the Union, Departments will meet with the Union to discuss and address safety 
concerns relating to facilities where employees are assigned to work alone while the facility is open to 
the public.  These discussions may include proposals to provide cellular phones, personal alarm 
devices, and/or other options where appropriate. 

 
553.  Where the employee has a good faith belief that a work assignment presents health and safety risks 
outside those normally associated with the work, he/she may refuse to begin or continue a work 
assignment. 

 
554.  When in such a case an employee declines to begin or continue a work assignment, she or he shall 
notify  his/her  in-house  safety  officer  of  the  situation.  The  in-house safety officer shall promptly 
investigate the complaint. While the employee is awaiting the arrival of the in-house officer, and until 
the officer has made his/her determination, the employee shall not be required to perform the disputed 
assignment. 

If  the  safety  officer  determines  that  the  complaint  is  valid,  his/her  decision  shall  override  the 
"departmental" management decisions, including abatement procedures or employee re-assignments. 
If, after investigation, the in-house officer determines that the work assignment does not present such 
an unsafe condition, he/she shall notify the employee. The employee shall then have the following 
options: 

 
continue the work in reliance on the decision; 
request a re-assignment, which shall not be unreasonably denied; or 
continue to refuse the work assignment. 

1. 
2. 
3. 

 
555. 

 
556. 

If the employee elects option three, he/she shall not be paid unless he/she executes an agreement that 
if it is ultimately determined that the complaint was invalid, the money shall be repaid to the City. If it 
is ultimately determined that the employee's complaint was valid, and he/she has not elected to be 
paid, the employee shall be made whole for all lost wages and benefits. 

 
557.  Employees shall not be subject to discipline or retaliation for exercising any rights under this Section 
unless  it  is  finally  determined  that  the  employee's  complaint  was  a  gimmick,  e.g.,  was  made  or 
pursued in bad faith or for ulterior motives unrelated to the merits of the dispute. 

 
558.  The Union may employ or assign its own safety consultant to investigate the situation in conjunction 
with  the  City's  in-house  officer.    If  after  consultation  between  the  two,  the  dispute  remains 
unresolved, it shall be submitted for final determination to a neutral arbitrator selected pursuant to the 
provisions of the section covering Expedited Arbitration (page 78) or another mutually agreed upon 
third party.

Compulsory Sick Leave 

617.  An appointing officer or designee who has reason to believe that an employee is not medically or 
physically competent to perform assigned duties, and if allowed to continue in employment or return 
from  leave  may  represent  a  risk  to  co-workers,  the  public  and  the  employee,  may  require  the 
employee to present a medical report from a physician designated by the Human Resources Director 
certifying the employee's medical or physical competency to perform the required duties. 

 
618.  The appointing authority shall notify the employee in writing of the specific incidents or behavior that 

is considered to cause risk to co-workers, the public or the employee. 

If the employee refuses to obtain such physician's certificate or if as a result of a medical evaluation, 
the employee is found not to be medically or physically competent, the appointing officer or designee 
may place the employee on compulsory sick leave and shall immediately report such action to the 
Human Resources Director. If the examining physician determines that the employee is not medically 
or physically competent and recommends the imposition of sick leave, the physician shall specify the 
duration of such leave. 

 
620.  At the request of the employee, the appointing authority or designee at the level of Departmental 
Manager shall meet with the employee - and if the employee requests, a representative of the Union - 
prior to the imposition of a compulsory leave.  The employee shall be informed of his/her right to

and County service who practices in the City and County of San Francisco, to conduct an 
evaluation and to report the findings.  This evaluation shall be conducted at the cost of the 
City and County.  The decision of the medical specialist shall be final and no further appeal 
shall be allowed.  If the medical specialist confirms the compulsory sick leave, the specialist 
shall specify the duration of the leave.

to  be  competent  to  return  to  duty  by  a  physician  designated  by  the  Human  Resources 
Director. The compulsory sick leave may be abridged with the approval of the physician 
designated by the Human Resources Director. 

 

Disability Leave 

624.  An employee who is absent because of disability leave and who is receiving disability indemnity 
payments  may  request,  by  submitting  a  signed  option  statement  to  the  employee's  department 
following  the    release  from  disability  leave,  that  the  amount  of  disability  indemnity  payment  be 
supplemented with salary to be charged against the employee's supplemental disability credits so as to 
equal the full salary the employee would have earned for the regular work schedule.  The regular 
work schedule shall be that schedule in effect at the commencement of the disability leave. 

 
625.  Supplemental disability credits shall be an account separate from, but equivalent to, the employee's 
accumulated unused sick leave with pay credit balance except that the supplemental disability credit 
account shall be adjusted as provided below. 

 
626.  Failure to exercise the option to supplement disability indemnity payments within 90 calendar days 

following release from disability leave will preclude later requests. 

 
627.  Supplemental disability credits shall be used at the minimum rate in units of one hour. 
 
628.  The  employee's  department  shall  submit  separate  timerolls  to  reflect  this  action  only  after  the 

Retirement System certifies the amount of disability indemnity payment, if any, for the period. 

 
629.  Salary may be paid on regular timerolls and charged against the unused sick leave with pay credit 
balance during any period prior to the commencement of the determination of eligibility for disability 
indemnity payment without requiring a signed option by the employee. 

 
630.  When an employee has used sick leave with pay credits and the Retirement System subsequently 
determines that the employee was entitled to disability indemnity payment for the period of absence, 
provision  shall  be  made  for  adjusting  the  employee's  sick  leave  with  pay  credit  balance  and  for 
reimbursing the appropriate City fund for the amount of sick leave with pay credits charged and paid. 

 
631.  An employee who uses supplemental disability credits to supplement disability indemnity payments 
shall, while on disability leave, earn supplemental disability credits at the same rate as sick leave with 
pay credits. 

 
632.  Upon return to duty, an employee who has used supplemental disability credits shall earn sick leave 
with pay credits at the normal rate and shall earn supplemental disability credits at twice the rate that 
sick leave with pay credits are earned until such time as the total hours of supplemental disability 
credits used are regained. 

 
633.  Should an employee suffer a recurrence or a new injury before all supplemental disability credits are 
regained, the supplemental disability credit balance shall be that balance existing at the beginning of 
the pay period in which the recurrence or new injury occurs and shall be adjusted for the amount of 
supplemental disability credits subsequently earned and sick leave with pay credits subsequently used.

minimum rate in units of one hour. 

 
635.  Vacation, CTO, or other paid time as well as SDI payments to an employee who qualifies and who 
has accumulated and is eligible to use sick leave with pay credits shall be supplemented with sick 
leave with pay credits so that the total of SDI and sick leave with pay calculated in units of one-hour  
provides up to , but does not exceed, the regular take home salary  the employee would have received 
(excluding voluntary or optional deductions)  for the normal work schedule excluding overtime. 

 
636.  An employee who wishes not to supplement, or who wishes to supplement with compensatory time 
or vacation, must submit a written request to the appointing officer or designee within seven calendar 
days following the first date of absence.

and/or  from  job  duties  regularly  assigned  to  employees  in  the  injured  employee's  class.    Where 
appropriate modified duty is not available within the employee's classification, on the employee's 
regular shift (including regular days off), and in the employee's department, the employee may be 
temporarily assigned pursuant to this section to work in another classification, on a different shift 
(including different days off), and/or in another department.  The City will make a good faith effort to 
avoid assigning the employee to work on a different shift or different days off, and will appropriately 
train the employee for the new assignment.  After a period of three (3) months, the parties shall 
evaluate the modified duty assignment in conjunction with the employee's medical restrictions.  It is

or vacation, must submit a written request to the Appointing Officer or designee within seven (7) 
calendar days following the first date of absence. Written requests made subsequent to this time shall 
be effective at the start of the payroll period following the request.  Disability indemnity payments will 
be automatically supplemented with sick pay credits (if the employee has sick pay credits and is 
eligible to use them) to provide up to the employee's normal salary unless the employee makes an 
alternative election as provided in this section. 

 
664.  Salary may be paid on regular time-rolls and charged against the employee's sick leave with pay, 
vacation,  or  compensatory  time  credit  balance  during  any  period  prior  to  the  determination  of 
eligibility for disability indemnity payment without requiring a signed option by the employee.

program shall continue in effect during the term of this Agreement, except that the employee’s pay 
shall be supplemented under the program up to the employee’s approximate net pay rather than gross 
pay.

Local 261, Service Employees International Union Local 790, Stationary Engineers Local 39, and Glazier and 
Glass Workers, Local 718, and the Public Transportation Department (“PTD”) hereby agree to create an 
Employee Assistance Program for fiscal years 1997-2000 as follows: 
 
A. 
This Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) shall cover employees only, and is designed to assist employees, 
in consultation with their families where clinically appropriate, with problems that may affect their ability to 
perform their jobs.  The EAP shall offer counseling services, including assessment, referral, and follow-up 
services. 
 

Overview of EAP Program 

EAP’s offer assistance by helping employees assess and identify problems arising from a variety of 
personal areas. 

EAP’s assist employees by referring them to services which lead to solutions. 

EAP’s provide training and consultation services to management and union leadership regarding 
assisting troubled employees. 

 
The primary goal of the EAP will be to maintain employee’s ability to be fully productive on the job.  EAP’s 
help employees, management, and supervisors maintain a high level of service by: 
 
 
 

Motivating employees to help; 

Helping supervisors identify troubled employees with job performance problems that may be related 
to personal problems; 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

Assessing employees with alcohol abuse, drug abuse, family problems, depression, stress and other 
problems that can result in performance problems;

Providing  follow-up  assistance  to  support  and  guide  employees  through  the  resolution  of  their 
problems; and by 

Acting as an education and training resource. 

 
 
 
Employees shall be able to access the EAP through calling directly (self-referral), through the Peer Assistants, 
or through a supervisory referral based on job performance.  Participation in the EAP is voluntary. 
 
Establishing  a  voluntary  EAP  to  compliment  the  mandatory  testing  program  is  intended  to  encourage 
employees to seek treatment early and on their own.  The EAP will assist employees in obtaining information,

D.  JOINT  COMMITTEE  FOR  SAFER  WORK  AND  IMPROVED  PATIENT  CARE  IN 

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH 

The City recognizes the importance and necessity of safe working conditions for 
employees and for adequate staffing for the provision of quality patient care.  To this 
end the Employer agrees that there should be a sufficient number of staff at all times.  
Staff levels will be evaluated as follows. 

Nursing:  Staffing levels in nursing units shall be based on case mix of patients, degree 
of complexity of care required, standards of care as identified by Title XXII, the 
Unit’s  average  daily  census,  the  skill  of  the  personnel  in  the  unit  and  clinical 
experience. 

Other  Subdivisions:    Staffing  levels  in  all  other  subdivisions  within  hospitals  and 
clinics shall be based on average workload, Title XXII, and clinical experience. 

Establishment  of  Staffing  Standards:    The  City  and  the  Unions  will  establish  a 
committee for each of the following divisions:  Nursing, Environmental Services, 
Dietary, and a fourth committee for other staff who are responsible for direct patient 
care. 

Composition of Committees:  The City and the Unions will each designate three (3) 
members to each committee.  Union members will participate in committee meetings 
on paid time, normally not more than four (4) hours per pay period.  If needed, the 
Director of Public Health may approve additional hours. 

Education  of  Committees:    The  City  and  the  Unions  will  agree  to  formulate  an 
educational program to assist the committees in accomplishing their goals. 

Committees’  Commencement and Conclusions:  The committees will begin within 
thirty (30) days of the ratification of this Collective Bargaining Agreement.  No later 
than six (6) months after the ratification of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, 
each committee will present its conclusion as to adequate staffing standards to the 
Director of Public Health.  If the Dietary, Environmental Services, or the committee 
for other staff who are responsible for direct patient care cannot reach agreement, 
both the Union members and the City members of the committees will each produce a 
report on those issues which remain unresolved to be presented to the Director of 
Public  Health.    The  Director  will  adopt  the  report  that  ensures  safe  working 
conditions and adequate staffing for the provision of quality patient care.  If both 
reports ensure safe working conditions and adequate staffing for the provision of 
quality patient care, then the plan costing the least amount of money will be adopted.  
Any plan adopted pursuant to this paragraph is subject to budgetary authorization.

By the end of the six (6) month period described above, the committee will 
produce a statement of all issues in agreement. 

Within fifteen (15) days of the end of the six (6) month period described 
above, the Union members and the City members of the committee will each 
produce  and  forward  a  final  report  including  a  proposed  resolution  of  all 
issues not agreed upon to the Director of Public Health for resolution. 

If the Union is not satisfied with the resolution reached by the Director of 
Public Health, the unresolved issues will be submitted to an advisory panel 
made up of a representative of nursing management, a representative of the 
Union, and a neutral third party mutually agreed to by the City and the Union.  
The advisory panel shall (1) review the Director of Public Health’s decision in 
light of the Union’s specific objections;  and (2) submit findings and specific 
recommendations  for  action  to  the  Mayor  who  shall  make  the  final 
determination within thirty (30) calendar days.

provided the time is made up. 

Employees who have not called in prior to their starting time will be allowed up to a 
thirty-minute time extension from the regular reporting time to report to duty, and will be 
subject to having pay withheld.  For all instances of tardiness, time will be computed in 
fifteen (15) minute units.  If such employee who has not called in is more than fifteen 
(15) minutes late, he/she may be replaced by another employee on his/her assigned shift 
and will be given a float assignment. 

All employees reporting late will report to the office of the designated supervisor at 

the time of arrival for appropriate assignment. 

Employees over thirty minutes late will not be allowed to work and will be considered 
absent without leave, provided that if an employee who is over thirty minutes late is told 
to come to work by the facility pursuant to (1) hereof said employee shall be allowed to

after having been notified in writing in advance of such proposed action.  Such refusal 
does not preclude the Department from taking subsequent disciplinary action.

or days off to his/her normal days off, and such approval shall not be unreasonably denied.

Department.  Such days off must be taken within the fiscal year of the date of the holiday or 
the following fiscal year.

their days-off schedule and work on a holiday.  The Department will first ask  employees to 
voluntarily request to change their days off to work a holiday.  If the Department needs 
additional employees to work the holiday, the least senior worker will be reassigned to work 
the holiday.

seniority will be determined by drawing lots.  The order of seniority shall be as follows: 

SENIORITY 

Employees shall not receive seniority credits for leave periods which exceed one year. 

SHIFT BIDS 

Shift bids will be conducted every six months, to start October 1 and April 1, unless either an 
abridgement  or  extension  is  mutually  agreed  to  by  both  the  Union  and  the  Revenue 
Department Manager.  The Revenue Department will meet and confer over the shift bid one 
month prior to delivery of the shift bid package to the employees. 

Shift bids will include days off, shift-times, all jobs for all personnel.  Jobs involving fare 
extraction assignments will rotate weekly during the period covered by the bid.  The schedule 
for rotating personnel will be distributed as soon as possible but no later than the Monday 
prior to the scheduled work week. 

Shift bids will be conducted with the most senior employees bidding first; however, employees 
who do not submit shift bids will drop to the bottom of the list and will bid on those shifts 
not filled.

Training will be provided at the request of any employee who successfully bids on a job he or 
she may be unfamiliar with; training will consist of not more than seven (7) working days 
except as follows: 

1. 

Training to operate: 

a. 
b. 

Forklifts 
Heavy Duty Vehicles 

2. 

3. 

Which shall be for no less than 10 consecutive working days within a 14 calendar day 
period. 
 
Receiver at Cable Car: 

This training will consist of three (3) consecutive days on the shift being trained, to 
insure that any and all details of shift work are learned. 

After such training, the Shift Supervisors will ascertain that the trainee is fully trained 
by accompanying trainee on a field trip or reviewing work performed as a cable car 
receiver.  If the Department wishes to reassign an employee after the training period 
and a minimum assignment of 30 calendar days on the job (including the training 
period), the Department will offer to such employee an employee conference to be 
held at least three working days prior to the proposed reassignment.  If requested by 
the employee, a representative of the Union may be present.  At the conclusion of said 
conference, the Department may declare such employee reassigned and his or her 
position vacated. 

Between sign-ups any vacated position(s) to be filled will be offered to remaining employees 
through the bidding process based strictly on seniority.  If the position(s) vacated is caused 
through reassignment(s), the reassigned employee(s) will be assigned to the position(s) that 
becomes available as the result of the bidding process. 

If a 9116 position remains unfilled after completion of the sign-up or becomes vacant between 
sign-ups, the vacancy may be filled by the assignment of, in inverse seniority order, qualified 
employees as determined by the Revenue Department Manager.  The reassigned employee(s) 
will be given a notice of assignment at least 14 calendar days in advance of the reassignment. 

If new shifts become available or are deleted between sign-ups, the Revenue Department 
Manager will conduct a new sign-up as described in Section 2.E. 

Subject to emergencies, there will be regular relief personnel for each Cable Car shift plus as 
many back-up personnel as the Revenue Department deems necessary.

A. 

OVERTIME HOLIDAY PAY 

For purposes of this section the four work units are:  Fare Extraction, Revenue Center, Pass 
Unit, and Cable Car. 

Holiday sign-ups will be held 30 calendar days prior to each scheduled holiday.  The holiday 
sign-ups will be based on classification seniority within units as defined in Section 3A.  The 
employee  shall  have  the  right  to  refuse  the  holiday  work  should  the  need  arise.    The 
Department will make an effort to offer holiday work to the next senior volunteer.  If that 
effort is unsuccessful, the Department may then assign the work based on inverse order of 
seniority. 

The Department will make an effort to offer all overtime to  the most senior employee on 
RDO assigned to the unit requiring overtime.  The limit for each employee is 16 hours per pay 
period and/or a maximum of 200 hours per calendar year.  These limits can only be exceeded 
upon prior approval of either the Revenue Division Manager or the Supervising Fiscal Officer.  
At Cable Car, the Revenue Department will offer 4-4 overtime shifts if both affected receivers 
can be contacted and both receivers agree to the 4-4 overtime shift.  If this is not possible, an 
employee will be assigned by the Revenue Manager to work the required overtime.  

Employees  will  be  allowed  to  accumulate  compensatory  time  off  when  it  is  received  in 
increments under 8 hours in order to take a full day off at a time they request.  Requests will 
be granted in accordance with Section 4A of this agreement. 

The Revenue Manager will provide a copy of the overtime and holiday records of all Revenue 
employees to the Chief Steward.

REQUESTS FOR TIME OFF 

The Revenue Department will grant requests for paid and unpaid time off (single days) as 
long as they are requested within five (5) working days of the requested time off during the 
current sign-up period.  Permission will be limited on any one day to the first requesting 
employee in the Revenue Center; the first requesting employee in the Pass Unit; and the first 
two (2) requesting employees in Fare Extraction. 

The Department shall hold a vacation sign-up during the second month of each year.  The 
final vacation list will be posted no later than April 1. 

The requests will be honored based on classification seniority within units.  Units are defined 
as Fare Extraction, Pass Unit, Revenue Center, and Cable Car. 
 

The employee shall have the right to cancel the vacation should the need arise but the employee will 
then be allowed vacation “time”  as determined by the Revenue Manager.

C. 

In the event two or more employees within a unit sign up for the same dates, seniority will prevail.  
The Revenue Department Manager will determine how many employees can be granted vacation 
during the same period but each employee must be offered his or her amount of annually earned 
vacation. 
 
Those employees who fail to sign-up within the deadline will be allowed vacation time as determined 
by the Revenue Manager, but must be offered his or her amount of annually earned vacation. 
 
A copy of the final vacation list will be forwarded to the Chief Steward. 
 
 
SECTION 5. 
 
A. 

The  Revenue  Department,  when  determining  the  starting  time  for  those  employees with 
rotating shift assignments, will provide the Sunday to Saturday assignments on the preceding 
Monday for the following week.  Employees not assigned to work on Monday may call the 
Revenue Center for their assignment schedule. 

NOTIFICATION OF STARTING TIMES 

The employees must give the Revenue Department a minimum notice of one hour when 
requesting sick leave and a minimum notice of four hours when requesting a return to duty 
from sick leave.  If the one hour notice is not received, the employee will be placed on unpaid 
leave.  If the four hour notice is not received, the employee will remain on leave for that shift. 

Starting times for each day will not be changed without at least twenty-four hours notice or 
only  with  the  consent  of  the  employee,  except  in  emergencies.    Once  an  employee  has 
reported  for  duty  and  the  Revenue  shift  Supervisor  desires  to  reassign  the  employee  to 
another Revenue worksite, the Revenue Department will provide transportation to and from 
the new Revenue jobsite unless employee elects to use own vehicle. 

 
 
SECTION 6. 
 
A. 

UNION ACCESS 

The  Union  representative  shall  be  granted  access  to  the  Money  Room  under  reasonable 
circumstances.  Access must be pre-arranged with the Revenue Manager. 

PHONE CALLS 

 
 
SECTION 7. 
 
Revenue Supervisors, upon the request of any employee, shall use a reasonable effort to transfer 
phone calls to the employee’s work area or give the number where the employee can be reached. 
 
This requirement shall in no way interfere with the Revenue Supervisor’s right to enforce work 
standards or performance.  Failure to transfer a phone call shall not be actionable or grievable.

POLICY CONCERNING SUBSTANCE ABUSE 

General Policy Applicable to Airport Commission Employees 

A. 

 
B. 

C. 

Employees are required to notify the Airport Human Resources Department in writing 
of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no 
later than five (5) days following such conviction.  Failure to make this notification 
may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 

It is also the Airport’s policy that the use of controlled substances and alcohol by any 
employee while on the job is prohibited and provides the same penalties for violation 
as set forth above.  The definition of "use" is not limited to actual consumption of 
controlled substances and alcohol (or any other means of introducing such drugs or 
alcohol into one's system) while on the job; "use" also is defined to include evidence 
of the presence at the levels indicated in Appendix A, of controlled substances or 
alcohol in an employee's system while on the job, irrespective of when the substance 
may  have  been  consumed  by  the  employee  or  otherwise  introduced  into  the 
employee's system In the case of alcohol, use is further defined later in this document. 

In certain circumstances, alcohol and drug addictions may be considered illnesses.  If 
an employee suspects that he or she has an alcohol or drug problem, help is readily 
available to the employee and his/her family if the employee self-identifies as outlined 
in  D.  below  before  commencement  of  an  investigation  or  disciplinary  process.  
Employees coming forward under these circumstances will not be disciplined absent 
other issues (e.g. using drugs while on duty).  Information on professional and self-
help  programs  for  intervention  when  a  substance  abuse  problem  is  suspected  is 
available from the City's Employee Assistance Program ("EAP") and the Airport 
Human Resources Department.  

D. 

Under conditions described below, the Airport will assist employees who identify 
themselves to the Airport as having a drug and/or alcohol problem and demonstrate 
their willingness to seek and accept professional help for their addiction.  

1. 

 
2. 

3. 

Such assistance might include granting the employee a leave of  absence, if 
such leave is determined to be necessary by substance abuse professionals, to 
obtain treatment for or help with the problem. 

An  employee  who  self-identifies  and  fulfills  his  or  her  obligations  for 
rehabilitation as recommended by an Airport-authorized Substance Abuse 
Professional ("SAP") may be subject to return-to-duty and follow-up testing 
as described in Section II.I. 

The  employee  must  self-identify  to  an  Airport  supervisor  prior  to  being 
approached by Airport managerial personnel with reasonable suspicion that 
the employee has a substance abuse problem causing unacceptable on-duty 

JULY 1, 2000 - JUNE 30, 2003 CBA BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND 

SEIU LOCALS 250, 535 & 790

II. 

 

behavior or prior to being asked to submit to a drug or alcohol test.  Self-
identifying  after  notification  of  a  drug  or  alcohol  test  will  not  relieve  the 
employee of the requirement to take a test, nor will it be cause to prevent the 
implementation of disciplinary action on the basis of the results of the test or 
refusal to be tested.  Likewise, an employee's self-identification following any 
conduct  which  constitutes  a  violation  of  this  policy  will  not  prevent 
disciplinary action. 

4. 

The Airport has designated the Airport Human Resources Director as the 
contact  person  responsible  for  answering  questions  about  this  Policy  and 
programs to assist employees.   

E 

The Airport retains all rights under the Civil Service Commission Rules and/or the 
Collective Bargaining Agreement if applicable to place employees on compulsory 
sick leave for on-the-job behavior that jeopardizes the safety of themselves or others. 

 
Policy of Testing for Reasonable Suspicion 
A. 

The Airport may test with reasonable suspicion for the presence of alcohol and or 
controlled  or  illegal  drugs  at  levels  set  forth  in  Appendix  A,  for  the  following 
classifications: 

 

B. 

C 

 

8202 Security Guard 
9202 Airport Communications Dispatcher 
9203 Senior Airport Communications Dispatcher 
9204 Airport Communications Supervisor 
9209 Airport Police Service Aide 
9212 Airfield Safety Officer 
9220 Airport Operations Supervisor 

 
The Airport may test all employees under the reasonable suspicion for the presence 
of alcohol.  

Purpose - The purpose of reasonable suspicion testing is to provide management with 
a method of identifying employees who may pose a danger to themselves and others 
in their performance of their job duties because of their use of drugs or alcohol, or 
both.  Employees may be at work in a condition that raises concern regarding their 
safety.  A supervisor must make a decision as to whether reasonable suspicion exists 
to  conclude  that  substance  abuse  may  be  causing  the  behavior.    The  supervisor 
making  this  determination  will  be  trained  in  the  facts,  circumstances,  physical 
evidence, physical signs and symptoms, or patterns of performance and/or behavior 
that are associated with use.  

JULY 1, 2000 - JUNE 30, 2003 CBA BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND 

SEIU LOCALS 250, 535 & 790 

A-62 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D. 

Reasonable suspicion testing will be administered when a supervisor who has received 
training as set forth in II.C. above observes covered employee behavior indicating 
possible drug use or alcohol misuse. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The supervisor must observe and describe specific behavioral, performance, or 
contemporaneous physical indicators of probable drug use or alcohol misuse.  
Upon making such observation, the supervisor will determine whether he or 
she believes the employee to be using drugs or misusing alcohol and order the 
employee to undergo testing as appropriate. 

The  supervisor  will  obtain  the  opinion  of  a  second  trained  supervisor,  if 
circumstances permit.  If both supervisors agree that reasonable suspicion 
exists, the employee will be escorted to the collection site by a supervisor and 
will  be  provided  transportation  home  after  testing  is  completed.    The 
employee may, at his or her request, instead of being tested, be evaluated by a 
medical  physician  at  SFO  Medical  Services,  if  a  physician  is  available.  
However, such an examination may involve diagnostic tests, including the 
drawing of blood or urine.  If a physician is unavailable, the employee shall 
submit to the required test. 

An employee who is tested for reasonable suspicion where the results are not 
available  immediately  will  be  placed  on  administrative  leave  without  pay 
pending receipt of the test results.   If the employee passes the test(s), all lost 
pay  shall  be  restored  to  him  or  her, unless there was conduct which may 
supply an independent basis for disciplinary action.   

4. 

Testing will cover the substances listed in Section III.F.1. below. 

E. 

 
F. 

Procedures for reasonable-suspicion testing are described in Sections III.F. and G. 
below. 

Employees employed in "safety sensitive" positions as described in Section III.A., 
who test positive may be subject to return-to-duty and follow-up testing as described 
in Section III.H.

D. 

The  Airport  has  determined  that  the  following  classifications  are  subject  to  this 
section: 

9202 Airport Communications Dispatcher 
9203 Senior Airport Communications Dispatcher 
9212 Airfield Safety Officer 

 
 
 
           9220 Airport Operations Supervisor 

The Parties hereby acknowledge and recognizing that to the extent that federal law 
mandates that more stringent standards or procedures apply to Airport employees, 
those standards and procedures shall supersede those set forth herein.  The Airport 
shall advise the Union of its determination that higher standards must apply, and will 
meet and confer with the Union regarding any impact of such a determination on 
matters within the scope of bargaining.  Nothing herein shall constitute a waiver of 
the Union’s right to challenge any Airport determination that higher standards must 
apply through available judicial processes. 

No employee may perform a safety-sensitive function when that employee has a 
prohibited drug, or an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or more, in his or her system.  
Employees  who  are  covered  by  this  section  currently  include  all  persons  in  the 
following job classifications: 
 
 

9202 
9203 
9212 
9220 

 
 
 
 

Airport Communications Dispatcher   
Senior Airport Communications Dispatcher 
Airfield Safety Officer 
Airport Operations Supervisor 

An employee in a safety-sensitive position may not consume alcohol for at least eight 
hours following an accident or until the employee undergoes a post-accident alcohol 
test, whichever occurs first. 

Possessing or consuming alcohol while on Airport property is also a violation of this 
Policy, with the following exceptions: 

1. 

2. 

Consumption, possession, sale or purchase of alcohol in certain approved 
restaurant, cocktail, conference or recreational facilities of the Airport when 
employees are not on working time and or not in uniform; and 

Possession of alcohol in sealed containers in an employee's private vehicle on

The Airport recognizes that confidentiality of information obtained in the drug and 
alcohol testing process is a critical concern to all employees who have been or will be 
tested.    The  Airport  will  handle  test  results  and  employee  information  in  a 
confidential manner.  All participants in the collection, testing and reporting process 
will be informed of their responsibility to protect the employee's privacy and testing 
program confidentiality.  Testing records and results will be released only to the 
limited designated personnel  authorized to receive such information. 

All employees performing safety-sensitive functions, as provided in III.A. above, shall 
be subject to urine drug testing and alcohol testing by an evidential breath testing 
(EBT) device, for reasonable suspicion (see G. below), following an accident (see H. 
below), on a random and unannounced basis, and prior to return to duty and on a 
follow-up basis after rehabilitation (see I. below).   

1. 

2. 

3. 

Drugs  to  be  tested  for  include  marijuana,  cocaine,  opiates,  phencyclidine 
(PCP),  and amphetamines.  Alcohol concentration is measured by EBT. 

If an employee in a safety-sensitive position refuses to take a required drug or 
alcohol  test,  tests  positive  for  any  of  the  above-listed drugs, or shows an 
alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, such employee shall be immediately 
relieved  of  his  or  her  safety-sensitive  functions,  shall  be  referred  to  the 
Medical Review Officer ("MRO"), and may be subject to discipline based on 
the facts of the case, up to and including discharge. 

If an employee tests positive for alcohol with an alcohol concentration of at 
least 0.02 but less than 0.04, that employee shall immediately be removed 
from service; said employee shall be counseled, and shall be advised to seek 
professional help in the event he/she may have a substance abuse problem.  
More than one instance of showing an alcohol concentration in this range will 
subject an employee to more serious disciplinary action.  If an employee is 
seen drinking alcohol while on duty, the employee may be subject  to serious 
discipline, up to and including discharge for the first offense. 

4. 

If an employee adulterates a specimen for drug or alcohol testing or otherwise 
falsifies or attempts to falsify the testing process or results, such employee will 
be subject to severe discipline. 

"Reasonable suspicion" testing as used in this policy means a drug or alcohol test 
required when a supervisor or manager reasonably suspects an employee of using a 
prohibited drug or alcohol while on the job, and when a second trained supervisor or 
manager, if one is available, agrees that reasonable suspicion exists. 

"Post-accident" testing as used in this policy means a drug or alcohol test required in 
the event of an occurrence (accident), in which an individual dies, or any nonfatal 
accident  involving  an  Airport  vehicle  in  which  an  individual  is  injured  and

immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene, or in which one or 
more vehicles involved sustains disabling damage as a result of the occurrence and 
must be towed away.  A post-accident drug test will be administered to an employee 
or employees when an accident, as defined above, has occurred and the employee 
performed a safety-sensitive function that either contributed to the accident or cannot 
be completely discounted as a contributing factor in the accident.  An employee will 
be subject to alcohol testing in a post-accident situation only when the employee's 
conduct causes a supervisor or manager reasonably to suspect that the employee may 
be under the influence of alcohol. 

"Return-to-duty" testing as used in this policy means a drug or alcohol  test required 
when the Airport allows an employee who did not pass a drug or alcohol test to 
return to work or when an employee has self-identified before any testing is required 
and has successfully completed an appropriate rehabilitation program.  The SAP must 
determine that the employee may return to duty.  Employees returning to duty as 
described in this paragraph may be given unannounced "follow-up" drug or alcohol 
tests, or both, if recommended by the SAP.  Such follow-up tests shall not exceed a 
two year period, unless special circumstances prompt the SAP to recommend an 
extension of this period.   

1. 

 
2. 

Purpose - The purpose of pre-employment testing is to identify applicants who 
have consumed a prohibited drug in the recent past.  This behavior has the 
potential to impact the workplace and may present an unacceptable safety risk 
to the employee, coworkers, passengers, and the general public. The Airport 
will not hire an applicant who tests positive in a pre-employment drug test.    

Coverage – Applicants, except current City employees, seeking the following 
positions  will  be  required  to  submit  to  urine  drug  testing  as  part  of  the 
selection process: 

a. 

Candidates applying for the following positions are subject to pre-
employment drug testing: 
8202 Security Guard 
9202 Airport Communications Dispatcher 
9203 Airport Senior Communications Dispatcher 
9204 Airport Communications Supervisor 
9209 Airport Police Services Aide 
9212 Airfield Safety Officer 
9220 Airport Operations Supervisor

B. 
 

 
 
Applicants, except current City employees, for classifications whose 
incumbents must obtain security clearances because of their access to 
areas secured by U.S. Customs will also be subject to pre-employment 
testing.  Such classes currently include: 

2708

Applicants who test positive, or who decline to be tested, will not be 
further considered. 

 
Pre-employment drug testing shall be administered only after the candidate has 
been given and has accepted a conditional job offer.  The conditional offer 
shall specify that a final offer shall be conditioned upon, among other things, 
negative drug test results. 

Collection and testing procedures for pre-employment drug testing will be the 
same as for other types of testing as described in paragraph F, as applicable to 
the circumstances, except that the individual will not be escorted to or from 
the collection site.

Random Testing 

1. 

The Airport will administer random drug tests to employees in classifications 
listed in Section III.A. of the Policy Concerning Substance Abuse Random 
drug tests will be conducted without advance notice during employees' normal 
working hours. 

a. 

b. 

All employees will be placed in a random testing  pool, from which 
random selection shall be made.  The Human Resources Director or 
his/her  designed  representative  shall  notify  said  employees  in  as  
confidential manner as reasonably possible.   

The random numbers or other identifiers assigned to all employees 
who  have  been  selected  for  random  testing  shall  be  immediately 
returned to the pool, so that everyone has an equal chance of being 
selected for the next round of testing.

2. 

The Airport will annually require at least 25% of the covered employees to 
undergo drug testing, except that the Airport Director may revise the testing rate 
after reviewing data concerning the rate of positive tests in the previous calendar 
year.  Random testing will be conducted throughout any given year at a relatively 
steady  rate,  although  the  days  of  the  week  and  the  times  when  testing  is 
conducted will vary.

D. 

Post-Accident Testing 

1. 

2. 

Purpose - The purpose of post-accident drug testing is to determine whether 
substance  abuse  has  been  a  causative  factor  in  an  accident  in  which  an 
individual  dies  or  is  injured  or  disabling  damage  occurs  to  one  or  more 
vehicles involved.  Although the first concern is the health of any accident 
victim(s), post-accident drug and alcohol tests must be performed as soon as 
possible  after  the  accident  and  after  it  is  determined  that  the  employee's 
performance cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor.   

Post-accident drug tests must be administered whenever a safety-sensitive 
employee is involved in an occurrence (accident) with an Airport vehicle in 
which an individual dies.  Testing is also required when in an occurrence an 
individual suffers bodily injury and immediately receives medical treatment 
away  from  the  scene  of  the  accident,  or  in  which  the  Airport  vehicle  or 
another vehicle involved incurs disabling damage and is transported away 
from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.  In such nonfatal accidents, the 
Airport will test a covered employee on duty in the vehicle if the employee has 
been cited or if the Airport Human Resources Director or his/her designated 
representative determines the employee's performance could have contributed 
to the accident. 

a. 

In the event of an accident described in 1. above, urine specimens 
must be collected,  not later than eight (8)  hours after the accident, 
from every employee who performed a safety sensitive function that 
either contributed to the accident or cannot be conclusively ruled out 
as a contributing factor to the accident.  Ordinarily, specimens will be 
collected as soon as possible after the accident, allowing for treatment 
of any injuries first.

A-68 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

b. 

c. 

d. 

e. 

Alcohol testing will be conducted only when the employee's conduct, 
besides  the  mere  fact  of  being  involved  in  an  accident,  causes  a 
supervisor or manager reasonably to suspect the employee may be 
under the influence of alcohol.  An alcohol test should be administered 
within two (2) hours of the accident, and must be administered within 
eight (8) hours of the accident. 

The decision to administer post-accident drug and alcohol tests will be 
made by an Airport supervisor. 

Supervisors will explain the reason for the tests to each employee to 
be tested and will escort employees to the collection site. 

Employees involved in occurrences as defined in paragraph D.2. above 
must remain available for testing following the accident and should be 
paid for this time.  The supervisor shall inform the employee(s) when 
he  or  she  may  leave.    If  an  employee  leaves  the  scene  without 
authorization  or  is  otherwise unavailable for testing, the employee 
shall be considered to have refused the test and shall be subject to 
appropriate discipline.  

3. 

If reasonable suspicion (see b. above) is also found in post-accident situations, 
the employee will be transported home and placed on administrative leave 
without pay until test results are received.  The employee will be reinstated  
and any lost pay will be restored should the test results be negative. 

E. 

Return-To-Duty and Follow-Up Testing 

1. 

2. 

Purpose - The purpose of return-to-duty testing is to provide assurance that 
the employee is presently free of alcohol and/or any prohibited drugs and is 
able to return to work without undue concern about continued substance 
abuse.    The  purpose  of  follow-up  testing,  which  will  be  specified  by  the 
Airport's SAP according to the circumstances of each case, is to ensure that 
an  employee's  recovery  from  substance  abuse  is  continuing  so  that  the 
possibility of accidents and injuries is minimized. 

Any employee who refuses to take or does not pass a required drug or alcohol 
test, and is not discharged, may not perform a safety sensitive function until he 
or she passes a drug or alcohol test, or both, and the SAP has determined that 
the  employee  may  return  to  duty.    The  leave  and  pay  status  of  any  such 
employee before return to duty will depend upon the circumstances. 

3. 

Employees who are subject to follow-up testing must undergo unannounced 
testing  if  such  testing  is  recommended  for  the  SAP.    The  duration  and

frequency  of  their  tests  will  also  be  determined  by  the  SAP,  but  may  not 
exceed 2 years unless circumstances arise which cause the SAP to recommend 
an extension.  The terms and conditions of any return to work situation will 
depend upon individual facts.   

 

 
F. 

4. 

Employees subject to follow-up testing will at all times remain in the random 
testing  pool  so  that  such  employees  may  be  required  to  undergo  random 
testing in addition to follow-up testing. 

Procedures  Common 
Post-Accident, Random, Return-to-Duty, and Follow-up Drug Testing 

to  Pre-Employment,  Reasonable  Suspicion, 

1.  When an employee must be tested for reasonable suspicion or following an 
accident, he or she will be escorted by a supervisor to the collection site.  
Upon arrival at the collection site, the employee will be required to follow the 
instructions of collection site personnel.  In other situations, the employees 
will not be escorted. 

a. 

b. 

The  employee  will  be  required  to  complete  a  urine  custody  and 
control form, the purpose of which is to ensure proper identification, 
handling, and confidentiality of the specimen. 

The employee will provide a urine specimen in a private enclosure 
according to instructions of collection site personnel. 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

The  employee  will  be  provided  with  a  securely  wrapped 
single-use collection cup or specimen bottle, to be opened in 
front of the employee. 

The employee will be required to provide a specimen of not 
less than 45 milliliters (ml.) of urine. 

The  collection  site  person  will  pour  the  urine  into  two 
specimen bottles (if a collection cup is used) or pour off urine 
in  excess  of  30  ml.  from  the  specimen  bottle  used  for 
collection  into  another  specimen  bottle.    This  process  will 
result in a split sample consisting of the primary specimen of 
30 ml. of urine and the split specimen of at least 15 ml. of 
urine.

SEIU LOCALS 250, 535 & 790 

A-70 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

c. 

d. 

The specimens will be sealed and labeled by collection site personnel.  
The employee will observe the sealing and initial the labeling.  The 
specimens  will  be  transported  to  a  laboratory  approved  by  the 
Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  ("DHHS")  for  actual 
testing. 

If  the  employee  is  unable  to  provide  at  least  45  ml.  of  urine,  the 
collection site person will instruct him or her to drink not more than 
24 ounces of fluids during a period of up to two hours.  The employee 
will  then  be  directed  to  provide  another  specimen,  and  if  he/she 
provides 45 ml. of urine, the first specimen shall be discarded.  If the 
employee  fails  to  provide  45  ml.  of  urine,  the  specimen  shall  be 
discarded and the employee referred to the MRO, who shall refer the 
employee for medical evaluation to determine whether the individual's 
inability to provide an adequate specimen is genuine or constitutes a 
refusal to submit to a drug test.  Applicants who do not provide 45 ml. 
of urine after this procedure shall not be considered further in the 
selection process. 

e. 

Employees will be escorted or directed to report back to their work 
sites or vehicles, as the case may be.  If an employee is being tested 
for reasonable suspicion, the Airport will arrange for transportation to 
the employee's residence. 

2. 

In certain limited circumstances, the specimen collection will be monitored. 

a. 

If  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  an  individual  has  adulterated  the 
specimen  or  otherwise  compromised  the  collection  process,  that 
individual  will  be  asked  to  provide  a  specimen  under  the  direct 
observation of a same-gender collection site person.  The following 
circumstances  may  result  in  a  request  that  an  individual  provide  a 
specimen under direct observation: 

(1) 

The employee has presented a urine specimen that falls outside 
the  normal  temperature  range  (90.5-99.8F) and declines to 
provide a measurement of oral body temperature by sterile 
thermometer or shows an oral temperature that varies more 
than 1C/1.8F from the temperature of the specimen.

SEIU LOCALS 250, 535 & 790 

A-71 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

 
(3) 

b. 

The last urine specimen provided by the employee (the most 
recent  test)  was  determined  by  the  laboratory  to  have  a 
less 
specific  gravity  of 
than  1.003  and  a  creatinine 
concentration below .2 g/L. 

The  collection  site  person  observes  conduct  clearly  and 
unequivocally indicating an attempt to adulterate the specimen 
(for example, substituting urine in plain view or presenting a 
specimen containing blue dye). 

 
If the employee refuses to cooperate with the collection process, the 
collection  site  person  will  inform  the  Airport  Human  Resources 
Director or his/her designated representative and shall fully document 
the non-cooperation on the urine custody and control form.  Failure to 
cooperate  may  result  in  disciplinary  action,  up  to  and  including 
discharge.    In  the  case  of  pre-employment  testing,  any  failure  to 
cooperate  by  an  applicant  shall  disqualify  him  or  her  for  further 
consideration in the selection process. 

3. 

4. 

The laboratory will perform screening of the specimens using a technique 
known as immunoassay.  All positive results will be confirmed using a second 
technique known as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 

All test results will be reported by the laboratory to the Airport's MRO, who is 
a licensed physician with knowledge of substance abuse disorders, in a manner 
designed  to  ensure  confidentiality  of  the  information.    Only  specimens 
confirmed positive by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry will be reported 
as positive by the laboratory to the MRO. 

5. 

The MRO, after appropriate review, will report test results to the Human 
Resources Director or his/ her designated representative. 

a. 

b. 

c. 

In the event of a positive test result, the MRO shall give the individual 
an  opportunity  to  discuss  the  test  result  with  him  or  her  before 
reporting the result as positive to the Airport. 

The employee shall be given twenty-four (24) hours to respond to the 
MRO's attempt to contact him or her; failure to respond within that 
time  will  cause  the  MRO  to  request  that  the  Airport's  Human 
Resources Director or his/her designated representative contact the 
employee and direct him or her to contact the MRO immediately. 

The MRO shall examine any alternative medical explanations offered 
by the individual to explain any positive test result.

d. 

 
e. 

If the MRO determines that there is a legitimate explanation for a 
positive test result, the MRO shall report that result to the Airport as 
negative. 

The MRO shall verify a result as positive to the Airport without direct 
contact with the tested employee when: 

(1) 

(2) 

The employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss 
the test; or 

The Human Resources Director has directed the employee to 
contact the MRO and more than two (2) days have passed 
without such contact occurring. 

f. 

The MRO shall notify each employee who has a confirmed positive 
test that he or she has seventy-two (72) hours in which to request a 
test of the split specimen. 

6.  When the MRO reports a positive result for an employee and depending on 
the facts of the case, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action, up to 
and including discharge 

7. 

All test results will remain strictly confidential, whether maintained by the 
laboratory, the MRO, or the Airport. 

Individual  test  results  may  be  released  to  a  third  party  only  if  the 
tested individual signs a specific written authorization to release the 
results to an identified person or if proper legal authority compels such 
release. 

The MRO will report results only to the Human Resources Director or 
his/her designated representative. 

The MRO will provide to the individual his or her tests result upon 
request by the individual. 

The Human Resources Director or his/her designated representative 
will  share  this  information  only  on  absolute  need-to-know  basis.  
Those receiving this information will be informed of its confidentiality.

8. 

An employee (or applicant) who does not pass a drug test administered under 
the  Policy  Concerning  Substance  Abuse  may  request  that  the  split  urine 
sample be tested by submitting a written request to the MRO within seventy-
two (72) hours of notification by the MRO to the employee of his or her right 
to request another  test.  The MRO will then direct, in writing, the laboratory 
to provide the split sample to another DHHS-certified laboratory for analysis. 

a. 

b. 

If testing of the split sample fails to reconfirm the presence of the 
drug(s)  or  drug  metabolite(s)  found  in  the  primary  specimen,  the 
MRO shall cancel the test.  The MRO shall also cancel the test if the 
split specimen is unavailable, inadequate for testing, or untestable.    
The MRO shall declare that the employee has passed the test in any 
circumstance where a second test is not possible through no fault of 
the  employee  or  that  test  fails  to  confirm  the  presence  of  any 
prohibited substance(s). 

The employee who has not contacted the MRO within the seventy-
two  (72)  -hour  period  may  present  to  the  MRO  information 
documenting  circumstances,  such  as  serious  illness  or  injury,  that 
unavoidably prevented the employee's timely request for testing of the 
split  sample.    If  the  MRO  determines  the  employee's  information 
adequately explains his or her failure to contact the MRO, the MRO 
shall then direct the testing of the split sample be performed. 

9. 

An employee who refuses to take a required drug test will be presumed to 
have tested positive, and shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, 
based upon the facts of the case, up to and including discharge.  

10.  An employee who does not pass, or who refuses, a required drug test and is 
not discharged shall be referred to the Airport's SAP for evaluation.   The 
SAP shall be a licensed physician who has knowledge of substance abuse 
disorders and their treatment.

Alcohol Testing Procedures 

1. 

2. 

Alcohol testing will be accomplished by means of an evidential breath testing 
device  (EBT)  approved  by 
the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety 
Administration  and  listed  on  its  Conforming  Products  List.    The  EBT 
measures an employee's alcohol concentration in exhaled breath.  

Alcohol  testing  will  take  place  at  a  testing  site  or  facility  and  will  be 
conducted by persons qualified as Breath Alcohol Technicians. 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

Employees and applicants to be tested will either report or be escorted 
to  the  testing  site  for  testing.    The  test  will  be  administered  by  a 
properly trained Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT). 

The BAT shall be trained to proficiency in the EBT he or she is using 
and in the alcohol procedures specified in this Policy.  

The  alcohol  test  shall  be  conducted  in  a  manner  that  provides  the 
employee with privacy to the greatest extent applicable. 

The EBT must be secured with no unauthorized access at any time.  
Only one test will be conducted at a time, and the BAT may not leave 
the testing site while the preparations for testing or the test itself is in 
progress. 

3. 

Testing process 

a. 

b. 

 
c. 

The individual to be tested must present to the BAT positive photo 
identification (such as a driver's license or Airport identification card). 
The employee or applicant and the BAT must complete, date and sign 
a  form  indicating  that  the  employee  or  applicant  is  present  and 
providing a breath specimen.  A copy of the completed form will be 
provided to the tested individual. 

The BAT will initially conduct a screening test. 

(1) 

The  BAT  will  open  an  individually  sealed,  disposable 
mouthpiece in view of the employee or applicant and attach it 
to the EBT. 

JULY 1, 2000 - JUNE 30, 2003 CBA BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND 

SEIU LOCALS 250, 535 & 790 

A-75 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

d. 

e. 

f. 

The BAT will instruct the employee to blow forcefully into the 
mouthpiece  for  at  least  six  seconds  or  until  an  adequate 
amount of breath has been obtained.  The BAT will then show 
the employee the test result displayed on the EBT or on the 
printed result. 

If the result of the screening test is an alcohol concentration 
less than 0.02, no further testing is required and the test result 
will be considered as negative. 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

If the test result shows an alcohol concentration of  0.02 or 
greater, a confirmation test will be performed. 

 
The confirmation test must be conducted at least 15 minutes, but not 
more than 20 minutes, after the completion of the screening test.   

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

During the interval between tests, the employee may not eat, 
drink, or put any substance into his/her mouth.  The employee 
will also be instructed not to attempt to belch.  (However, the 
test  will  be  conducted  even  if  the  employee  disregards  the 
instructions.) 

The confirmation test is conducted using the same procedures 
as the screening test, with a new mouthpiece. 

If results of the screening and confirmation tests differ, the 
confirmation test result is deemed to be the final result. 

If the result displayed on the EBT is not the same as that on 
the  printed  form,  the  test  will  be  canceled,  and  the  EBT 
removed from service. 

Following completion of the testing, the BAT will sign and date the 
form, and the employee will sign and date the certification statement.  
The BAT will attach the alcohol test result printout directly onto the 
alcohol collection form with tamper-proof tape (unless the results are 
printed directly on the form). 

In the event of an incomplete test, the BAT must begin a new test 
using a new alcohol testing form with a new sequential test number.

(2) 

Refusal by an employee to complete and sign the alcohol testing form, 
to provide an adequate amount of breath, or otherwise to cooperate 
with the directions of the BAT will be deemed a refusal to be tested, 
will result in a presumed positive test, and may subject the employee, 
depending on the facts of the case, to disciplinary action, up to and 
including possible discharge.  Refusal by an applicant to do any of 
these things will result in rejection from employment. 

If the employee fails to provide an adequate amount of breath, 
he or she shall be immediately referred to a physician, who 
shall determine the employee's medical ability to provide an 
adequate amount of breath. 

If the physician determines that no there is no valid medical 
reason for the inadequate breath, the employee's failure will be 
considered a refusal to take the test. 

 
If a screening or confirmatory test cannot be completed, the BAT 
must, if practicable, begin a new test using a new alcohol testing form 
with a new sequential test number.

The external calibration check of the EBT produces a result 
outside the allowed tolerance levels. 

A device other than an NHTSA-approved EBT is used. 

The BAT does not wait 15 minutes between the screening and 
confirmatory tests. 

The alcohol test form with the attached EBT printout is not 
completed  correctly.    Employee  and  BAT  signatures,  or 
relevant BAT remarks, should be included.

The EBT fails to print the confirmation results, the sequential 
test number on the EBT is not the same as the number on the 
printout, or the alcohol concentration displayed on the EBT is 
different from what is printed out.

Consequences of Positive Result 

a. 

Any  safety-sensitive  employee  whose  confirmation  test  shows  an 
alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater shall be removed from service 
and will be advised to go to the Employee Assistance Program or to 
seek  other  appropriate  treatment  in  the  event  he  or  she  may  a 
substance  abuse  problem.    A  second  such  incident  will  result  in 
disciplinary action.  If a safety-sensitive employee’s test results are 
0.04  or  greater,  the  employee  will  be  immediately  removed  from 
service, escorted home, and referred for an evaluation by the MRO or 
SAP.  Depending on the facts of the case, that  employee may also be 
subject to appropriate discipline.  In addition, the MRO or SAP must 
approve of the employee's participation in a rehabilitation program, if 
appropriate, if the employee is permitted to return to work. 

(1.) 

The MRO or SAP shall determine, among other things, the 
employee's fitness for duty, whether and what rehabilitation 
programs may be appropriate, the period of time the employee 
should be subject to follow-up alcohol testing after return to 
duty  as  discussed  elsewhere,  and  whether  follow-up  drug 
testing should also be included. 

(2.)  Assessment by the MRO or SAP shall be scheduled as 
soon as is feasible.  The employee shall not be permitted to 
work in the interim. 

(3.)  Assessment by the MRO or SAP shall not affect the 
Airport's right to discipline, including discipline an employee 
including discharge if circumstances warrant, for being under 
the influence of alcohol.

b. 

If a non-safety sensitive employee's  confirmation test is less than 0.04, the 
employee  will  be  allowed  to  return  to  work,  barring  other  extenuating 
circumstances.  If a non-safety sensitive employee's confirmation test is 0.04 
or greater, that employee will be advised to seek treatment in the event he or 
she may have a substance abuse problem.  The employee may be counseled or 
disciplined, depending upon the test result level and upon the circumstances 
and behavior of the employee.  The employee shall be relieved of duty for the 
remainder of the shift and escorted home a second such incident may result in 
more severe action. 

If a non-safety sensitive employee's confirmation test is 0.08 or higher that 
employee shall in addition to the above, be referred to the MRO or SAP. 

Employee Self-Identification 

A. 

Employees having substance abuse problems may self-refer to the Airport's Employee 
Assistance Program through an Airport supervisor or through the Human Resources 
Department, or may otherwise self-identify and seek rehabilitation for a chemical 
dependency problem without penalty.  The Airport encourages employees having 
substance abuse problems to self-identify, and will assist in coordinating treatment, 
including authorizing applicable periods of leave for the employee to be treated.   
(Each  case,  however,  will  be  evaluated  on  its  own  facts.)    Self-referral  or  self-
identification after notification of a required drug or alcohol test will not relieve the 
employee of the requirement to take a test, nor will it prevent the administration of 
disciplinary action on the basis of the test results or a refusal to be tested.

HEALTH CARE REFORM 

Letter of Agreement 

In Support of National Health Care Reform  

 
The Union and the Employer agree to write and sign a joint letter in support of national health reform. The 
letter will be based upon the following ideas and set of principles. 
 
Skyrocketing health care costs threaten the living standards of workers and the financial stability of state and 
local governments. 
 
The parties  recognize that the problem cannot be solved through collective bargaining alone.  Health care 
costs cannot be adequately controlled on a plan-by-plan, employer-by-employer, or even on a state-by-state 
basis.  Rather, a national framework for a health care system that works in partnership with the states is 
required to solve the three related problems of cost, quality, and access. 
 
National health care reforms should recognize the best of local and state initiatives, including health care 
reforms that improve access, maximize delivery of cost-effective preventive care, and establish medical care 
payment programs designed to reduce overall medical costs.  The parties recognize that cooperation between 
labor and management will increase their effectiveness in achieving changes in state and federal policy that 
both support. 
 
Universal Coverage:  Health system reform must guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, with 
universal coverage and access for all people who live in California and in the United States, regardless of 
culture, class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. 
 
Role of Public Health Departments and Public Sector Providers:  Public health departments provide essential 
population-focused health promotion and disease prevention services that are not typically included as part of 
individual  health  care  benefits  through  insurance  coverage.    Examples  of  these  services  include  disease 
control, health education, public health nursing services, disaster planning, emergency medical services and 
environmental protection services.  These services must be recognized and adequately funded in any health 
reform plan. 
 
Even under the most comprehensive national plan, public sector providers will be essential to any health care 
delivery system.  This is for at least three reasons:  First, the public sector must always be ready to respond to 
health care crises, such as the HIV epidemic.  Second, the public sector must be  available to provide services 
to  those  who  do  not  have  access  to  other  providers.    Finally,  there  will  always  be    individuals  whose 
circumstances have not been planned for in the comprehensive health care plan, and services need to be 
available to them through the public sector.  It is absolutely essential to provide access for persons who are 
not able to receive appropriate health care service in other ways through the preservation of a strong and 
well-financed institutional safety net. 
 
Comprehensive  Benefits:    There  must  be  a  guaranteed  broad-based  benefit  package  that  emphasizes 
coordinated preventive and primary care services for individuals.  Covered services must include disease 
prevention and health promotion programs which will assist in long-term cost containment.  The plan should 
also include specified programs currently provided by public health departments, including mental health, 
family planning, long-term care, and substance abuse services.

SEIU LOCALS 250, 535 & 790 

A-92 

 

 
Cost Containment:  Health reform must include a package of cost containment measures to control operating 
and capital expenses because excess costs ultimately limit access to services.  These measures should be based 
on appropriate regulatory provisions and should cover all components of the health system, without creating 
barriers to appropriate care.  Appropriate cost  controls include evaluations of technology and procedures, 
utilization of the most appropriate procedures at the most appropriate level of care, resource planning for 
distribution of capital and medical technology, and global budgeting. 
 
Financing:  Health reform must recognize that individuals in society ultimately will pay for the financing of 
any health system.  The health system should be financed through a combination of progressive financing 
mechanisms that reflect ability to pay. 
 
Quality Assurance:  There must be mechanisms and safeguards to ensure effective and efficient organization 
of services and high quality care.  Mechanisms should include a process of appeal to ensure that patient rights 
are respected.  Quality assurance should also address the cultural competence of care and assess whether 
culturally and linguistically appropriate services are being delivered. 
 
Development of Health Workforce:  Comprehensive health system reform must include support for the 
education and training of health care workers to ensure: (1) adequate financing; (2) appropriate supply and 
distribution of workers, geographically and across specialties; (3) affirmative action to reach to goal of 
appropriate representation of all cultural and ethnic minorities in the health care workforce; and (4) culturally 
competent care through multicultural education and training of all providers.  
 
Ongoing Planning and Evaluation with Consumers, Communities and Providers:  To ensure accountability to 
providers and consumer communities and the protection and promotion of consumer rights, there must be 
mechanisms to ensure ongoing planning and evaluation of the system.  These mechanisms include consumer 
satisfaction surveys, community-based needs assessment, measures of quality of care, technology assessment, 
and diverse representation on all advisory committees.

Bargaining Agreement: 
 
Handling of HIV+ and Hepatitis C+ Claims 
 
1.  The City Attorney and the Director of the Workers’  Compensation Division of the Department of Human 
Resources agree that in the normal course of events, they can properly manage workers’  compensation 
claims involving HIV and Hepatitis C using a pseudonym.     

 
2.   The Deputy City Attorney assigned to the matter and the claims adjuster assigned to the matter may 
disclose the true identity of the applicant to the Managing Attorney of the City Attorney’s Office and to 
the  Director  of  DHR’s  Workers’  Compensation Division for limited purposes, only if disclosure of 
applicant’s identity is necessary to resolve an issue relating to payment or provision of benefits including 
the form, amount and duration of benefits.  In such an event, the city will give unrepresented applicants or 
represented applicants’  counsel notice of such disclosure in a timely manner.

3.  In addition, the applicant’s name, address and social security number shall be disclosed only as necessary 
to and between the parties described in paragraph 2, above, and to the treating physicians, medical and 
other experts and any agents of these parties requiring the  information to provide the services requested. 

 
4.  The City employees described in paragraph 2, above, will maintain files involving HIV and Hepatitis C in 

confidence in accordance with all applicable laws. 

 
5.  Applicant may designate a trustee for purposes of payments. 
 
6.  Unless required to do so by Court order or any applicable laws, the City shall not disclose applicant’s 
HIV positive or Hepatitis C status in the subpoena or discovery process unless the disclosure is provided
